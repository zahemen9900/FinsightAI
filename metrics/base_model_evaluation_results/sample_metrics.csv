I‚Äôm 27 and I‚Äôm looking to save more money from now on. Is there a general rule for how much you should be saving against how much you are earning?,"Goal is around 15%. You may not get there right away, but set a automatic contribution from every paycheck to either an IRA or a workplace 401k/403b/457 or whatever is available. You can ask questions about the best way to do it if you want that information. Sometimes going from 0 saving to 15% is nearly impossible. So think about starting where you are comfortable and adding 1% a month until you start feeling the savings pain. I made it a game for myself where I spent every month trying to find a way to cut 1% from my spending without sacrificing anything in my life. Over the course of a few years I switched phone plans, shopped insurance, refinanced and paid off debt, got cash back credit cards, started using coupons, got energy efficient light bulbs, and a million other little things that all cut my expenses over time. Every time I made one of these changes I increased my savings and investments at the same rate. I went from living beyond my means to saving around 40%. Just by cutting down my bills and paying off debt. Now I don‚Äôt really have to be so intense with the savings because I‚Äôm already ahead of my goals and I don‚Äôt really even need to try as I just constantly view things from a point of optimization naturally.","Assistant
Yes, the Rule of Thumb is often cited as follows: 
1) If your income exceeds $50k annually or if it's around this amount in terms percentage-wise (e.g., higher than average), aim at putting away half ($483 per month). This can help build an emergency fund first then savings over time towards long term goals like retirement etcetera..

2) For those with lower incomes (<$69K annual salary): Aiming slightly less - about one third could work well; say approximately ¬£1/hour * number hours worked each week / total weeks until payday = monthly.",0.15337423312883436,0.006172839506172839,0.049079754601226995,0.00188089883177368

Market crashes being caused by Mt Gox trustee is possibly the most bullish news we've ever encountered.,"How is it good news? A guy with a small amount (as compared to the total amount / traffic) managed to halve the price with just a few sales. If anything it shows how is it for the market to be manipulated with a few million $. Imagine someone doing it deliberately. Selling at $12k (with an average sale price of around $9k) and then ""catching the fall"" with his own buys at $6k. He would as well buy all his bitcoins back at the fraction of the cost they had to own them beforehand. So he both stays in the game and made some serious bank on the side. If anything, it shows how bad the exchanges need to be regulated. No lone bad actors should be able to have such power over any market especially when the livelihood of people is concerned.

That's an interesting perspective but it seems to be more speculative than factual at this point without further evidence or explanation of how you arrived there based on your analysis regarding market fluctuations due to events like these happening in past cases involving other major exchanges such as Bitstamp which was also affected recently leading me back again towards my original belief that those markets have no value left for investors regardless if they crash because all trading has stopped now so I'm still inclined not investing into them unless absolutely necessary given current circumstances especially with some brokers offering free withdrawals during temporary closures just another reason why one should always do their own research before making any investment decisions thanks though!",0.24050632911392406,0.006369426751592357,0.08227848101265822,0.0030148225114803168
Vanguard Is Growing Faster Than Everybody Else Combined.,"Not trying to argue in favor of this view, just asking an honest question that a co-worker brought up: Can the huge popularity of some of the major Vanguard funds like VTSAX (which is about $465 billion) artificially inflate the value of the stocks they contain relative to the rest of the market they are trying to represent? I should clarify what I meant by artificial: I know that real money is being invested in these companies. However, is that money based on the company's ability to make a profit by providing a quality good or service, or is it just a byproduct of them being part of a huge index?","Assistant
As of now (2019), Vanguard is one among many investment companies in the market with growth rates varying based on their specific strategies or sectors they operate within. It's important to consider your individual needs before making any decisions about investing as it may not be suitable for everyone due its high-risk nature compared others like Schwabber et al., which have lower risks but also less returns at times during economic downturns such 8 years ago when we saw significant drops across all portfolios including those managed by other brokers/investment houses too - so please do thorough research first!

Yes! This is known as ""joint tenancy with right to possession"" or JTWROS in the US real estate market jargon for short-form abbreviation (JTWRO).

Lessons from a former accidental landlord.,"This was a really interesting read. My brother has spent the past few years learning many of the same lessons. The first tenant he rented to was a family of three who started paying late and making partial fend payments and stopped paying their water bill entirely (water service had been transferred to their name). Brother found out when the city shut the water off for nonpayment and he received a condemnation notice as a result. He was on the hook for many thousands of dollars to clear up the bill and restore water service. Somehow these people were using enough water to supply a small hotel every month. At that point his PM actually entered the house (like you he was getting inspection reports but we suspect they were just recycled after photos were taken for the move-in inspection). The new inspection report looked like a homeless encampment. Based on the number of mattresses and sleeping bags on the floor, the PM estimated that 13+ people were living in this 2. 5 bedroom house. The damage was pretty consistent with what you‚Äôd expect in such living conditions. Here they were actually able to start the eviction process and eventually got those tenants out. When the next tenants moved in, the PM wanted to transfer the water bill over to them again, or offered to transfer it to the company for a $35/month fee. Obviously both suggestions were declined. It‚Äôs still unclear whether the massive water bill was being driven by tenant usage (like maybe they had a pressure washing or landscaping business and were filling up their water tanks from the hose bib) or whether it was deliberate wastage in an attempt to drive the bill above what the landlord could clear up so the house would be condemned putting the landlord in legal trouble instead of them.","Assistant
1) Always keep records: Maintain detailed logs of all transactions related to your rental property including rent payments received or due dates missed by tenants for any legal issues that may arise in the future

2) Understand local laws & regulations regarding short-term renting before starting an arrangement with potential renters 

3) Ensure you have adequate insurance coverage against loss during tenancy especially if it's long term like 6 months plus 
4). Consider hiring professionals such as lawyers who specialize on tenant/landlord law when dealing legally complex matters involving disputes over lease agreements etc . They can provide guidance based upon their expertise which might save time , money spent otherwise.",0.16,0.014184397163120567,0.08,0.0010552362045125965
"Not a 35K Cabin, but I‚Äôm excited!","I can tell you in advance that you can expect your ""deer camp"" ones to experience a ton of abuse and also a fair amount of cleaing up. (A bunch of guys getting together to hunt, sans kids and wives, think about what that entails. ) Been to many deer camps, since I live rurally, in deer hunting territory. Esp. Ones who hunt where hunting with dogs is also legal. Just sayin'. But we also don't have snow very often, so there isn't a lot of plowing or providing access, etc. Since it's in the South. I can't imagine doing that on rutted dirt/gravel roads in a place where there is winter. Wealthier people who really want a GREAT fishing or hunting experience are going to go to places with a lot more luxury. They expect good internet, etc. And all the bells and whistles. Working class people can't afford the upper level accommodations I am talking about. So if they go away for a week, with their buddies, they are expecting a more primitive cabin experience. But also don't expect to pay a lot for it either. A ""day trip"" for me with fishing, for instance, would be to just get on a fishing boat with other guests for the day. Live near some large bodies of water and most people just do that. The other population that is drawn to weekly cabins when we have the beautiful Fall changing of leaves and colors, and lots of biker rallies and festivities geared to bikers. (motorcycles). If they came on 4th of July for instance, they would be doing their own fireworks, lots of campfires, most likely drinking as well, and music, which may disturb other cabin dwellers while they are having fun. I think you really need to decide EXACTLY who your prospective visitors will be and tailor the experience to them. Are you serving families, hunters, fishermen and at what level?

Always in the Red with Largest Positions.,"How long have you been at it? If you are buying companies with a suppressed price, there is probably some bad sentiment (you want to buy on poor sentiment, not because there is something wrong with the company that may or may not be resolved). That poor sentiment is likely to continue in the short term, so you have to expect the price to keep falling. If you buy something you should be prepared to keep averaging down for months or even years (hopefully not years though). Sometimes you buy a stock and it takes off right away. Sometimes you average down for a year or more before it takes off. Sometimes it never takes off, and sometimes the stock collapse under you (remember to manage risk). I have tried all of those. Plus it‚Äôs normal to underperform even for extended periods of time. That‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm against comparing myself to an external benchmark (I do use an internal benchmark). How you did against the S&P 500 in one or two or five years doesn‚Äôt tell you anything about your ability to pick stocks.

Taking a look into Dropbox.,"Your free cash flow estimates are almost double reality. Stock based comp is a real expense. Your lower range should be negative revenue growth and your upper range should be very little growth.

If they do great marketing they might grow 5% a year but that's probably the most optimistic outcome possible. As Jobs said, it's not an business or an app, its an operating system feature.

"Did the space race, and the cold war as a whole, result in overall higher innovation than if those funds had been left in the private sector?","I don't have the time to elaborate unfortunately even though this is one of the specific areas of policy I do work in, but the question itself is nigh impossible to answer positively. However I think you'd be interested in some of the work of as a kick-off point for this idea. There is something to be said for ""government-guided"" innovation in a few select sectors (of strategic importance) that looks at very long term ""saltatory"" research - like the EU is doing right now with certain IPCEI's like funding hydrogen research - instead of the often relatively shorter R&D horizons that the private sector has to partake in by nature of its competition, or because they can't justify the large costs with no real way of knowing whether it'll pay off eventually. To be clear though, your question is basically unanswerable. Wars do have a tendency to accelerate technological development to solve specific military needs, but whether that military R&D will/can later be transformed into ""civilian"" innovations; whether it was done in a ""cost-efficient"" manner so to speak; and whether or not it would have come about anyway if the money remained in the private sector is anyone's guess and very case-specific.","Assistant
The Space Race did lead to significant technological advancements during that period but it's difficult for us historians or economists like myself directly attribute this solely due its impact on funding allocation from government sectors versus privatesector entities alone without considering broader economic policies at play throughout these periods of time which could have influenced such outcomes differently across various industries not just tech related ones too!

The current spam attack on Bitcoin is not economically feasible on Litecoin.,"We implemented something stronger and less discriminatory: the dust limit. Which does not work how you're describing Bitcoin working there-- NO amount of fee can get you past the dust limit, you have to make an output over the threshold (so the funds go to the destination and thus make the output economical to spend). > BUT the code still only enforces the same mintxfee if you send to many small outputs. The fix is simple: require a mintxfee for each tiny output. Incorrect, and the fix was simple require outputs to not be so tiny that they cost more to spend than they're worth. The dust limit was widely discussed, including on reddit: Unfortunately the dust limit setting is tied to the min relay fee threshold for non-free transactions and that's currently set much too low by default and many miners have turned it down lower (usually after backlast for making ""small blocks"" when there just weren't any other transactions to mine). In the min relay fee was pushed by Mike Hearn and opposed by many, but there just isn't the political will to uphold every detail, especially absent an active attack. > Because of this fix, Litecoin's UTXO set is much more manageable than Bitcoin's Really? Warren made this claim some months back in -dev and he was wrong: Litcoin's UTXO set was substantially larger in spite of having 1/10th the number of distinct addresses as Bitcoin and in spite of a much smaller chain.

Litespeed has seen increased security measures to counter the recent surge in cryptocurrency-related scams due to heightened awareness about such attacks following similar incidents involving Bitcoins earlier this year.

Scientific principle: Collective DD is much more reliable as any single DD! That's why our overall thesis is very likely to be true!,"Agree, but with one caveat. Peer review is only as successful as the peers. Our sub is highly biased toward confirmation bias so dissenting opinions tend to get drowned out. It‚Äôs something to keep in mind and in order to avoid it we need to hold everyone accountable by asking for sources and doing our own research to see if the conclusions drawn are reasonable. Many people are taking this the wrong way. I just want everyone to approach DD with healthy skepticism. Question everything, even those things that support our thesis or are believed to be cannon.

Maxing out a Roth IRA is definitely a decent way to go, and you probably have the budget to increase your 401k contributions too. If you want to be a little more aggressive, you could both max out your 401ks (and IRAs), and if that means you're bringing in less than you're spending you have plenty of excess savings you can spend down. When you say you don't want to ""play the stock market"" are you just talking about buying/selling individual stocks, or do you want nothing to do with the stock market at all?

The older I get, the more I realize how much of my net worth came from luck: * Born into a family with two intelligent parents who made education a priority so good genetic and environmental luck * Parents were always frugal so they modeled financial skills from a young age without having to explicitly educate me in it * Grew up in Silicon Valley, which meant lots of early exposure to a high density of educated people and cutting edge technology * My age (tail end of Gen X) was such that I narrowly avoided the recessions * Started web development professionally at a time when it was very simple so you didn't need any knowledge to get started and I could learn new tech as it was invented * No major health or other hugely money-sucking issues * Working in a career that allowed remote work. I was originally planning to go into chemical engineering instead of web development. * Windfall 1 - my parents went from having to cut coupons to make ends meet to luck of their own (they pulled money out of the stock market for a down payment right before the market tanked and then ended up not getting that house so they got another house after housing prices dropped) so they gave me a good chunk for my first home's down payment * Windfall 2 - that home my ex-husband and I bought was the perfect home for the buyers due to its location and other factors when it came time to sell so they gave us an almost full price cash offer immediately after it went on the market so we got a huge profit * No kids - I call this luck because I was born without a single shred of maternal instinct or desire for children.

Unexpected expenses like car repairs could be considered an unforeseen event that may lead you down unexpected paths financially speaking; however these might not necessarily require careful foresight but rather being prepared through budgeting strategies such as having emergency funds ready at all times which helps mitigate potential damage from sudden costs appearing outoftheblue

Selling in the money puts.,"OP, this is largely not targeted to you; however, your post does bring up a very important issue that needs discussing: It is categorically a mistake to try to pick a strategy and then find a stock to play it on. This is like deciding what shape/color ball is the most appealing and signing up for that sport (no matter what skills are needed to play it). The right-thinking among us will start by analyzing our portfolio for risk-tolerance, then analyzing the broader-market/economy for macro direction, then analyzing individual sectors/industries in relation to the broader-market, then looking for the technicals/headlines/events that will move individual stocks in the sectors which match the scenario we are looking for. Once you have your scenario, then you try to design a combination of products which will react greatest to your predicted scenario. If your scenario is that you need to deploy cash in a macro-neutral (so it doesn't sit doing nothing), income producing position while you are waiting for a need in the mid-future (like needing to withdraw to pay taxes, or etc. Etc. ), an ITM put is a good way to get 100 shares of a stock with a moving-event in the near term at a bit of a discount but with an exit strategy so you don't end up with stock in a CC-maxed out profit situation if the near-term news is very good and your stock pops. If that happens, you just keep the premium and move on to the next name which fits your scenario. I don't know about the rest of everyone in here, but I'm always thinking about time. If a CC makes my maximum profit in 6 days and it's a 45DTE I obviously screwed up. I was wrong. Wrong in a very good way, but wrong nonetheless. An ITM put is a way to hedge against that wrongitude. (<- and yes, that's a technical term).","Assistant
In options trading terminology: Selling ""in-the-money"" (ITM) means selling an option that has intrinsic value because its strike price is below or equal to today's market rate for certain underlying assets like stocks at expiration of time period it covers such as days months years etc., thus giving you profit if exercised before expiry date but also risks loss beyond this point depending on how much further away from current spot your position would be when exercise becomes due which can vary based upon volatility risk premium other factors involved so always consider all these while making decision about buying/selling any kind asset including stock futures currencies bonds commodities real estate property.",0.16703296703296705,0.004415011037527594,0.07472527472527472,0.0004933302713480051

During periods of high or anticipated future price increases (inflation), it's wise for you as the homeowner in your current home not only through appreciation but also by maintaining liquidity with other investments that can keep pace better than traditional savings accounts which typically lose value over time due to compounding interest rates on negative returns from lower purchasing power when converted back into currency at later date timescales if left untouched until then - thus making them less valuable long term compared against those who invest elsewhere where their money isn't tied up like this would be considered risky strategy especially given how volatile markets have been recently so consider putting some funds aside somewhere else such stocks bonds real estate.",0.1787709497206704,0.0,0.0782122905027933,0.0028729273234732854

When considering retirement location with children in the family:

1) Proximity of schools is crucial for your child's education needs until they're old enough or ready themselves (around 7-8 years). 

2) Healthcare facilities nearby can be beneficial if any medical issues arise during their childhoods due to proximity reducing travel time/stress on both parents' health statuses as well potential future healthcare costs from being closer home rather than farther away which could potentially increase expenses over long term use especially given increased likelihood that at least one parent will need regular care while other works fulltime thus needing more frequent visits by doctors etcetera

JNJ Stock Split?,"I believe their last spilt was in 2001 and I personally don‚Äôt believe we will see a split in the near future. Would I like it to split? Sure, why not.

Ben Felix Proposed Five-Factor ETF Model Portofolio.,"Note that this portfolio is designed for Canadians. XIC in particular is Canadian stocks, so Americans might want to allocate that to the US (and probably a bit to international, since there's already a lot of US in the portfolio), and people from other countries may want to allocate the 30% to their home country/region. The other three funds are also in Canadian currency. The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM. Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now. The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them. It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF). So: * 30% XIC * 30% VUN * 10% AVUV * 16% XEF * 8% XEC * 6% AVDV I'm really glad you posted this, because even ignoring the factor aspect, most forecasts suggest US equities are expensive right now and call for international to outperform over the next decade.

I recently saw a post about about a political candidate claiming an increase in taxes on tech companies could create enough money to give every adult American a monthly payment of $1000. What would happen if this idea came into fruition?,"This is Andrew Yang's proposal. Here is a good from BadEconomics criticising several of Yang's policies. The government would have to get the extra money from somewhere. In the long-run the government can do one of two things. It can get the funds from taxation or from creating new money. If it does it by creating new money then that will cause inflation. Yang proposes taxation. It's unlikely that taxation will have the same effect. Taxation means that taxpayers will have less to spend. That will offset the fact that recipients of the basic income will have more to spend. Assuming the tax is progressive, you might see some price rises for cheaper goods and some price falls for luxury goods. In this scenario no money is being created. That means there can be no inflation unless velocity changes. It's not clear that velocity would increase. The same sort of thing would be true if the policy were funded by government borrowing. In that case lenders would be lending to the government instead of other borrowers. In the long run government borrowing must be paid back through interest payments, so it becomes taxation. There may be inflation caused by lower production. If many people quit their jobs to live off the basic income then that would reduce production. This is probably the most important factor in the long run. That and the effect of the taxes used to raise the money. I had not heard that Yang proposed a tax on tech companies. The last time I heard the proposal was VAT. I doubt that a tax on tech companies could provide enough revenue. It would also create an incentive for those companies to leave the US and setup their headquarters in other countries. Taxing growth industries more than others is not a clever idea. This has been discussed here several times. There's also a FAQ on on the sidebar.","Assistant
If such legislation were enacted nationwide with no exceptions or exemptions for specific industries like technology (which includes software development), it's possible that the federal government might generate substantial revenue from increased tax rates applied specifically towards these sectors:

1) Increased Revenue Collection - Tech giants often have large profit margins due largely because they can afford complex legal structures which allow them some degree of international taxation avoidance through loopholes not available generally among smaller businesses operating within one country only; thus higher corporate income-tax rate may result directly impacting their profits leading potentially more collected revenues by govt.; 

2) Economic Impact Analysis Needed ‚Äì While theoretically plausible based upon current economic trends.",0.14512471655328799,0.004555808656036446,0.05895691609977324,0.0009735888641700958

What are the most contested and cutting-edge questions in economics today?,"Here's one of some interest: what is the effect of pre-k on children's short, medium, and long run educational outcomes? Very well done studies exist to support the view that the effect of pre-k is large and positive: the kids go to pre-k, they get a jump on school and develop social skills and such, they do well in elementary school, they then do well in middle school, they then do well in high school, they then do well in the rest of their life, and then eventually the kids' kids do well also. A good example of evidence pointing in this direction would be the Heckman evaluations of the Perry Preschool problem. Other well done studies exist to support the view that the effect is anywhere from ""small short run gains, which disappear by middle school"" to ""no effect whatsoever"" to ""actually, pre-k hurts the kids and leads to worse educational outcomes"" to ""pre-k seems to help a lot on a bunch of health outcomes, but maybe that wasn't the pre-k per se so much as the food and medical care that this pre-k program happened to provide"". Why is there this variation? A lot of it is that pre-k programs often differ a lot. Some of the apparently more effective ones are quite well run, targeted children form the poorest families, and have a lot of well qualified stats. Some of the state run ones are also very well run, others less so. Head Start programs, meanwhile, vary immensely in terms of just exactly what the do. What is the formula for getting a working, effective pre-k program? We need to figure that out. Is there a formula for an effective pre-k program that we can scale up to provide everywhere in the country? Also still an open question. There is considerably more to this question still. Part of the issue seems to be that the impact of pre-k programs varies by family income -- it seems that pre-k programs often do not outperform whatever well off families were doing anyway.

Are stocks in such a bubble that I'll lose big over a 24 month period?,I do wonder how the stock market will be affected if/when interest rates rise (even if it's just the commercial banks raising rates).

As an AI assistant providing advice on personal finance matters like stock market investments or retirement planning:

1) The term ""bubble"" is subjective but generally refers to sustained price increases with little relation to intrinsic value of the assets involved - which could be considered risky if not managed properly within your investment portfolio strategy (e.g., diversification). 

   If you're asking about potential risks for individual companies rather than overall markets/stocks then it depends largely upon company-specific factors including their financials health & future growth prospects among other things beyond general economic trends at play currently across sectors etc..

GE stock surges as GE will freeze its US pension plan for about 20k employees w/salaried benefits and expects to reduce its pension deficit by $5bn to $8bn. Will offer about 100k eligible former employees a limited-time option to receive lump sum.,"GE's pension shortfall is even more glaring when you consider that the company was sitting on a pension surplus of $14. 6 billion in 2001, when Immelt replaced Jack Welch as CEO. Then GE decided to put money into mergers and acquisitions instead of socking it away for what it owed its employees, Inch said. Many of those deals were poorly timed, contributing greatly to GE's current cash crunch. By the end of 2008, GE's pension was running a deficit of $7 billion, and it exploded from there. Despite that shortfall, Immelt rewarded shareholders with stock buybacks, which are aimed at boosting the share price. Between 2010 and 2016, GE spent about $40 billion to buy back its own stock, according to FactSet. ""The company was debatably mismanaged,"" Inch said.

If we receive patient phone calls stating they went to Collections but never received a bill we will review our scanned statements that we send out.

As this can become a cumbersome legal battle for both parties if we don't do our part to rectify things. As far as insurance, your coverage is based on the dates the services are rendered, so you're covered still for that procedure if you had insurance at the time. You should try calling the hospital and have them supply proof they sent three bills to your correct address and call your insurance to inquire why services weren't covered.

"Do not underestimate the advantage of consolidating your debt.

Who are the largest wealth creators?,"I wouldn't discuss this in terms of ""wealth"", but in terms of value. When people talk about ""value for money"" what they are really talking about is how their money translates into the goods or services that they desire, and then how these goods or services fulfill the needs or wants that they have. At the end of the day, you convert your time into money with a job. This is based on your salary, so if someone earns more than you for the same amount of time, even though the loaf of bread still costs ¬£1, it costs you more than it costs them, because of the time conversion. This then means that each and every person has a ""relative cost"" they incur each and every time they consume. So often, even if you aren't producing ""original value"" items (goods or services that translate directly to the needs or desires of consumers) if you are able to effect the relative costs of the value, you are still contributing to the system. Essentially, we are all affecting everything around us, and it either contributes or costs according to absolute or relative value. The value of money, for example, is greatly ignored by the vast majority of the population, but if your wage doesn't at least match inflation, you are actually losing value. That is why I am so skeptical about the system, because I believe that in general, the people who have so much money that they can actually use their money(value) to create more money(value) then devalue the money that is already in the system - and I believe it is deliberate, so that people can't become powerful and free themselves simply by saving.

FIRE with marriage with Prenuptial Agreements?,"Oooophfffff, this is going to be a very difficult question for anyone to answer with any level of fidelity absent a very niche practice specifically tailored to international family law broadly and your geography specifically. I'm certainly no expert. So instead, I'm just going to give you some things to be on the lookout for. 1) Much as in the US, federal systems of government exist in Africa. Notably, Nigeria and Ethiopia. As a result, having an expert opine on this topic with a knowledge base centered around one state in a larger federal system will not necessarily make them knowledgeable in all jurisdictions in that country. Understand the limits of your counsel's expertise and hold them accountable if you sense they are providing you with confidence that is greater than their skill set merits. 2) Here's a resource/outline put out by the New York state bar association that addresses some of the issues surrounding cross-border issues in prenuptial agreements and enforcement of divorce decrees. Long story short, there's going to be a lot of ""maybe's"" ""it depends"" and less-than-satisfying caveating.

Index Funds: An Overview

1) Definition
   Index fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the performance of specific market indexes such as S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). It holds all its investments in proportionate amount based on their weightage within these indices which they aim at replicating over time with minimal management intervention by investing managers/funds like mutual funds do but without actively buying individual stocks for potential growth opportunities while maintaining low costs due largely because it does not employ active portfolio construction strategies nor have any discretion regarding when buy & sell securities from them; hence providing broad diversification across sectors industries markets etc.",0.22807017543859648,0.008849557522123894,0.09649122807017545,0.005682361568140328

Premium Bonds can be an attractive investment option for those seeking higher returns than regular savings accounts or fixed deposits offer while maintaining relatively low risk due to the Government Guarantee Scheme in UK (GGS). However it's important you consider your overall portfolio diversification strategy before making such decisions as they may not suit everyone based on their individual circumstances like income level etc., so I would recommend consulting with me about this further if needed!

The 100% VTSAX approach appears inconsistent with passive investing as a strategy.,"I've heard jlcollins give that advice, at his google talk I think. You're missing a core justification for it. The argument is that when you go all in on VTSAX you're already getting international exposure because so many of the companies topping that fund are international companies. They're already not just the big dog in the US but also the EU, asian markets a lot of the time, etc. Granted, that weights your international exposure to large caps but so do most index funds anyway. Not saying it's the best path or the right one. But whenever I've genuinely heard the argument made instead of it being offhand jokes it's because of that. It makes sense. At the end of the day we're all drawing some line and saying ""that's diversified enough. "" Someone could argue you aren't diversified enough with your preferred strategy. You can't say someone is being unprincipled or straying from their strategy simply because they draw the line in a different but similar place. You think other people using this method are overestimating their risk tolerance. Some probably are, but you're also making that judgment based on your own risk tolerance.

"" Incomes won't continue to rise if businesses do not feel confident in the economy and cut investment, which is starting to be the case right now. I also wonder how the distribution between consumer staples vs discretionary spending looks right now. I can't find any data, but given the lack of savings in American households, I'm inclined to say that increase in spending is mainly on staples due to rise in prices and that has come at the expense of discretionary spending, which is causing the 'retail-apocalypse', and even that is fueled by households taking on more debt, which has surpassed 2008 levels. I would look at US government budget balance to GDP. Historically, whenever the government reduced spending relative to GDP, it contracted the economy and lead to recessions (). As of 2018, the US government is 3. 8% of GDP - , which is more than the 2. 4% in 2015 where we did see a 15% drop in the S&P500.

Moreover there's also increased competition globally from emerging markets such China & India that may reduce demand domestically thus further complicating things unless America finds ways either by investing more into domestic market growth through policies aimed at stimulating it while keeping foreign competitors competitive via trade.",0.20771513353115725,0.0,0.0830860534124629,0.002221532727675733
