Why not just buy VFV?,"Not going to force my opinion on anyone else, but for me there's just no financial world without North America. I think the Ukrainian invasion draws a thick uncut red line between countries you want to deal with and those not. Extrapolate this any country where the president sits longer than two terms. Europe and Japan are cute but in geographic proximity to unstable actors to the extent appeasement hinders growth. Like it or not, the US, Canada and UK will likely be headlining the new world order and emerge least scarred. The alternative world order will have no consumer trading, just ask the Russians how Moscow Exchange and GazProm dividends are doing.

Variable fund sales charges (FFSC) can be significant upfront costs compared to mutual funds like VTSAX or VSCHD that have no FFSCs associated with them in most cases due to their investment objectives being defined by the underlying securities they hold rather than how often you sell shares of an actively managed portfolio over time as variable plans do through reinvestment options on statements from brokerages when additional contributions exceed earnings at any point during your plan's accumulation phase while also offering tax-deferred growth benefits upon withdrawal which is attractive for many investors seeking higher returns relative to traditional IRAs especially if one has high income levels making it more likely.",0.19917012448132781,0.008368200836820083,0.08298755186721991,0.005013695065930216,112,8,False,1,5.633928571428571,True,True
Why I bought LLOY at a time like this.,"> Anyway finally, the psychology behind why I should have stayed with VG. There are no purchase fees! When I buy through AJ and I see that there is a £10 dealing fee I feel a loss. This is mentioned heavily in investment books but I want to talk about the psychology behind it. In Thinking Fast Thinking Slow there is lots of talk about how we as humans react to loss, there are lots of studies mentioned in the book and it is fascinating. The essential take-home point here is that we as humans see loss completely different to gains. You can feel ecstatic finding £5 on the floor but feel a huge sense of dread when a scooter taxi rips you off by £5 in Vietnam and you think about it for the rest of your life! This might sound crazy, but I like dealing fees. (Has anything sensible ever started ""this might sound crazy but. ""?) They're a check on my trading habits. I don't want to be someone who buys and sells shares on a whim, or tries to become a ""trader"". I want to buy and hold for the long term. Dealing fees act as a barrier to me for both buying and more importantly selling. Now if you're investing small amounts of money at a time to the point where dealing fees are a significant fraction of your investments then I can see it would be a big problem. I don't like trading fees on mutual fund purchases, mind, that's where I make my regular monthly investments. Most brokers don't do this though.","Assistant

The concept of working four days per week has gained popularity in recent years as companies adapt to remote or hybrid models due to COVID-19 restrictions. However it's important that any company considering this approach carefully assesses their operational requirements before making an implementation decision based on hypothetical productivity gains alone without careful consideration for other factors such as staffing levels required at different times during each shift (e.g., morning vs evening), meeting regulatory obligations like minimum number hours worked by certain employees etc . In addition there may be significant administrative costs associated with implementing changes including hiring additional staff if necessary who would need training which could offset some potential benefits from reduced workload among existing.",0.14814814814814814,0.0125,0.07407407407407407,0.00482318587937741,119,0,True,3,6.176470588235294,True,True

How do HFT Algos make money when there are so many fees?,"It's all a number's game. First, bigger participants may get lower fees by market making.

Hedge funds use algo trading to access liquidity markets at lower costs than traditional brokers offer retail customers through their order books or clearing houses like Interactive Brokers (IBKR).

Salary versus Pension: Consider your personal risk tolerance when deciding which option suits you best for retirement income planning purposes.

Determining if the premium of an option is too high or fair priced.,"Good question. How do you know if toilet paper is overpriced?

For my family of 5 I would have gladly paid 3x the normal price to get TP a few weeks ago and I may even call that underpriced because demand was so high. At the end of the day option prices are set by buyers and sellers. You won't know until after it expires if it was overpriced or underpriced. A lot of puts were underpriced in early February 2020 but were likely overpriced by the end of February 2020. You can graph realized volatility vs. Implied volatility to get a feel for when options were overpriced or underpriced. &; To answer your question though, if people had a way to know which options were over or underpriced ahead of time that would be like printing money. The best we can do is look at historical option prices (IV) and see how it changes over time, around earnings events, etc. And try to make a prediction on if when think its over or underpriced.","Assistant
To determine whether your options premiums seem reasonable to you as compared with other investors in similar positions on that specific stock at those exact times can be challenging due largely because it depends upon how much risk was taken by each investor relative not only their own personal circumstances but also market conditions when they bought them so I would recommend comparing what others paid for comparable contracts rather than trying directly compare yours against theirs unless there's something about which we're specifically asked here such perhaps pricing versus performance data If all else were equal then yes simply take note over time do some research see where things have gone since purchase evaluate current risks including volatility potential loss etc adjust accordingly based off.",0.23602484472049692,0.0125,0.09937888198757763,0.0039008845655713288,127,5,False,1,5.480314960629921,True,True

Is Rent to Retirement legitimate?,"In my opinion if you want to invest in real estate you really have only two real options. Buy a REIT - you get professional management, consistent dividends and appreciation which has historically been very good. Or You buy an investment property yourself. Now you can go the easier route and buy a NNN property, like a walgreens, which is a mostly hands off investment, but is that really worth the risk when you can buy a REIT for probably the same or better return with a lot more diversification? Or you buy a multi-family or single family that you manage. Yes, you can make money, but I can tell you it is a lot of work. I've been managing my own multi-family properties for 17+ years now and it is a lot of work. I love it and you can make higher returns than a REIT, but it takes a lot of work and experience to do that. Everything else has a sales pitch, but look at the historical rate of returns for REITs and compare. Are any of these ""Other"" investment opportunities really worth the risk for similar ""projected"" returns?

Removing any discussion of a short squeeze, GME is an investment into a turnaround start up company focused on mass-democratization of NFT ownership among multiple assets and classes (it seems). LRC is an investment into the means by which that's possible. Are they connected? Sure. Are they the same? No. GME will lift LRC and LRC will lift GME, each to places not otherwise obtainable, but as investments they differ in what they mean fundamentally. Both are excellent investments I wager.

In which scenario would Developed world index would be outperformed by all world index?,"As you said yourself growth isn’t the only criteria.

The developed markets (developed worlds) typically include large-cap stocks with higher dividend payouts compared to the developing market indices that may have more growth potential but lower dividends as they invest in new business ventures or reinvest their profits back into companies for expansion rather than paying high regular payments like established corporations do through dividends on stock sales from shareholders who bought shares of these businesses over time at various times throughout history when those same investments were profitable enough so investors could sell them off now instead just starting an investment today).

Tl;dr - market makers sell you the LEAPS and offset it with an inverse trade, so dont worry too much about that aspect.","Assistant
Leaps can have significant downsides too - they're not risk-free investments like stocks or bonds! The main downside is that you'll likely be locked into the contract until it matures without any chance of early redemption unless your broker allows them as part of their trading platform (which isn't common). If market conditions change significantly between when buying this leap option starts expiring on one day versus another then there's no guarantee at all what strike price will actually match up with how much money gets paid out by either party if/when expiration date arrives in future months later down road which could result from various factors including but certainly aren’t limited.",0.2441860465116279,0.023529411764705882,0.09302325581395347,0.006648829094422161,113,4,False,3,5.283185840707965,True,True

WSJ: The Federal Reserve is preparing to effectively abandon its strategy of pre-emptively lifting interest rates to head off higher inflation.,"All the money printing, zero interest rates forever. Isn’t it apparent what is happening? We have a national debt which can never be repaid. On top of that we have so many unfunded liabilities it is insane. They are trying, along with other countries to devalue our currency. Look at gold, their policy seems to be working. Another stimulus. Nobody even cares anymore what the cost is or even think about how we would attempt to ever repay it. Buy companies or physical assets. This will not end well. There is no “getting back to normal” anywhere in the foreseeable future. Now they say even when we get the inflation we shouldn’t concern ourselves about it and just keep everything at zero forever.

I'm not sure what's happening there but I can offer some insights from my own research on the topic! Higher wage growth tends towards lower unemployment which leads directly into increased demand for goods & services causing prices like housing or gas etc., as well impacting consumer spending in general - thus contributing further too price increases; meanwhile with more money circulating through this economy it also helps fuel business investment by providing additional revenue streams so they're better positioned going forward when things settle down again if that makes sense?

Investment advice for someone that started too late.,"You have 18 months worth of your combined gross income sitting in cash. Sounds like you've been pretty good at saving but that's a lot of cash. In most cases there's no reason to have more than 6 months worth of expenses (not gross income) as an emergency fund. You can definitely afford to invest more. Maxing out a Roth IRA is definitely a decent way to go, and you probably have the budget to increase your 401k contributions too. If you want to be a little more aggressive, you could both max out your 401ks (and IRAs), and if that means you're bringing in less than you're spending you have plenty of excess savings you can spend down. When you say you don't want to ""play the stock market"" are you just talking about buying/selling individual stocks, or do you want nothing to do with the stock market at all?

Malta sounds too good.,"Yes, this is how it works and it is a scheme to attract new residents. No, you do not need to reside abroad for this to apply (the scheme is called resident without domicile, meaning your center of interest is abroad but you reside and pay taxes in Malta), so yes you can only legally pay the minimum 5,000 euros tax (note: if you move your residence in Malta but spend months at a time in another country, you will have issues with that other country, but this is valid for any country in the world). Is it crazy? Well, Malta is not a high income country and the average yearly wage is around 20k/Euros per year (source: literally the first result when googling). The normal income tax goes from 0% to 35%, and someone with 20k euros in yearly income would hardly pay 25% (5,000 euros) per year. If they have kids they would easily pay close to zero. So, from the perspective of the government, they get an above average tax income and a new (most likely) high income / high wealth resident that pays rent, buys food and contributes to the country.

I'm not sure I agree with that assessment.

If you're concerned about storing your money safely due to rising rates or potential economic downturns while still wanting some diversification beyond traditional savings accounts with low interest yields (like checking), consider opening an account specifically designed for emergency funds that earn slightly higher returns than regular bank offerings but aren't as volatile in times of uncertainty like stocks might be right now: High-yield Savings Account/Money Market Fund can help balance risk tolerance against need without sacrificing too much return compared to keeping it under mattresses yet maintaining liquidity when needed most during periods where markets may not perform well enough on average over short timeframes—which could mean between 3 months up through one.",0.16470588235294117,0.011904761904761904,0.08235294117647059,0.005248819564626871,115,8,True,1,5.895652173913043,True,True

I'd say the biggest mistake was not understanding that algorithmic trading is just as much about risk management (and therefore portfolio construction) than it's technical aspects like programming or data analysis toolsets. Also overlooking how important backtesting strategies with realistic market scenarios actually were before deployment in live trades would be another major one I think for many traders new to this field but experienced at other types of trade execution methods though certainly less sophisticated ones such as manual order routing etc - which can lead them down an easy path into making rookie errors they wouldn't have otherwise made if instead focusing on learning fundamentals rather then trying out their own AGI-like algorithms.",0.22340425531914895,0.03225806451612904,0.10638297872340426,0.007418704868132812,116,5,False,2,5.620689655172414,True,True

Warren Buffett said.,"For Buffett, his ability to understand the value of an asset is much like when we watch a performance by LeBron James or Michael Jordan.

Buffett's advice here is all but worthless because his patience is not what makes him successful in the market but the vast wealth of data, research, and analysis he has available to him on a micro and macro scale to make the right decision at the right time.

Due Diligence of Bitcoin Mining stock valuations: RIOT and MARA.,"FINALLY a decent analysis of mining that understands network difficulty. There’s still a couple nits: Two years is still an optimistic lifetime for a miner. Just because that’s the depreciation rate doesn’t mean they’re actually in service that long. 18 months is probably more realistic. The cost of hardware is critical. When you have such a short lifespan on hardware, capex is actually your dominant cost not electricity/opex. The reason miners talk about electric costs so much is because it’s the only thing they sortof control. You can’t do anything about the price Bitmain charges. Capex is the majority of your miner’s lifetime cost, and since you pay it upfront, cash flow sucks. Network difficulty will more than double and be worse than your estimates. BitMain will absolutely oversell miners. Also, since difficulty adjusts every two weeks, you can’t just multiply profitability by a year. You really need to project a difficulty curve and integrate it. I can’t emphasize enough how much and how quickly difficulty plummets profitability. I completely agree with your conclusions that these are severely overpriced losers, and want to emphasize that there is no moat. Source: I formerly ran a mine.","Assistant

Father dying in hospital. Need some advice.,"This same thing happened to my partner a few years ago, when we were in our mid-twenties. Here are a few tips we discovered along the way that saved us: - Hire an estate lawyer right away. Go talk to them immediately (although remember they will likely charge by the hour) and make a list of things you will need to do. Your father’s estate will need to go through probate court to officially transfer things over to you, you want a lawyer to handle all of that. - Get organized. We kept a giant, three-ring binder with all of our paperwork in it (copies of tax records, home records, will, whatever else you end up with). Even now, several years later, we pull that thing out every now and then when we need it. We also had a google doc with all the important numbers we kept needing to know—birth date, social security, address, etc. Super helpful. We also kept a google doc list of his friends, important people and their contact information. That was helpful when arranging things like a funeral, or just reaching out for whatever reason. - Hire someone to do your taxes this year (when you get all his assets, it’ll be interesting) and his final taxes. Those were the big ones that really helped us. You will get through it, be gentle on yourself and take your time. Probate can take forever, but that’s okay. Besides some things that need to happen right away, there isn’t really a rush after that. Good luck.","Assistant

We offered a combo of medical/dental benefits, annual reviews and spot wage increases so you might be well above the start wage posted or you might be just above but I picked up more of a percentage of your medical dental plan. Not making it well but the point is wages shouldn't be a hidden thing, having discussions around then keeps employers honest, they can't have a favourite or a relative at many dollars per well above everyone else, nor can they leave the meek behind if everyone knows what everyone else makes. But outside the workplace, in a social situation, if someone asked me the question my response would be to just look them in the eye and either tell them or tell them its none of their business. Depends on the situation.","Assistant

This will show that there might not actually have been any transactions recently on this particular day so they won't think anything of seeing $0 as their initial response if prompted by further questions like ""how did we get these statements?""

"⚡️ needs you. Yes, you.","One of the best ways to help prepare for the Lightning Network is to make sure you're ready to run a secure node and teaching others to do the same. Receiving payments on the Lightning Network requires that the recipient's node be online with autonomous access to the unencrypted private keys used to manage its payment channels. There is a substantial difference in the security requirements of an LN node compared to holding a Bitcoin wallet or even full node. Nothing will undermine public confidence in LN faster than if a widespread malware outbreak ends up stealing funds from early adopters. The pervasive data breaches across companies large and small demonstrate that most are not yet prepared for the responsibility that awaits them when Lightning strikes.

I think it’s interesting that you mention Bill gates divorce as an example of how the market can react to information - This shows he understands what investors need from him so they will buy into his stock when news about himself becomes public knowledge (like for instance if we were all shocked by something like “hey I bought my first car with 25k dollars back in high school”) but also because even though there was no direct impact on Microsoft due solely based off these two reasons; The fact remains people invested heavily through MSFT stocks before knowing anything at all which means their investment has already been impacted indirectly without them realizing!

Trading with a 9-7 Job.,"I use Tastyworks to trade futures. I mainly trade /ES and /VX contracts. The CBOE just extended trading for SPX and VIX options, but no brokers have jumped on board yet. It may be a while before enough market makers decide to jump into that 23-5 trading schedule. I will say if you decide to trade futures, just stick with futures if you don’t have enough cash for that and equities. Your broker will sweep you initial margin out of you account each day to cover the futures contract, and you can’t use that margin to also maintain the balance you need in the T Reg account to stay above the PDT threshold minimum.

I feel like I'll never make it out of poverty.,"I grew up similarly - single parent, bunch of half-siblings, section 8, WIC, food stamps, etc. I left my mom’s house when I was 16 to go to university, and for a few years there I was still paying for stuff in her house. Always for a “good reason” - electric bill, school supplies for siblings, etc. But also stuff that I honestly found myself resenting having to pay for: I paid for my mom to travel to my graduation, because if I wanted her there then I had to pay for it. She had four years to plan that travel! This is all while I was a student, so a lot of stuff went on my credit cards. I eventually got tired of being the family ATM, and started saying no, and then I went no contact with my family for a bit in my 20s (for a ton of reasons, not just money). And guess what? Without me around to pay for things, they figured their stuff out for themselves. Nobody went homeless, siblings have jobs, etc. We’re back in touch now, but there is no asking for money, and if there was there would be no giving of money.

"College aid fail ( lost $4,000 of aid).","Yeah… This is just plain incorrect. If you filed as a dependent, then FAFSA does not even look at your personal income. If you filed as an individual, then the $10,000 in savings would barely (if at all) affect your grant. It would be way more dependent on previous year’s income. Most likely, your parents lost a dependent (think sibling graduated or grandparent passed away) OR their income changed. Also, if they had previously claimed you as a dependent on their taxes but recently you began claiming yourself (which would be the case of you directly received the stimulus payments) then that could reduce your Pell because for tax purposes your parents had fewer dependents. There are lots of other things that can change a Pell grant too. I believe Pell grants get reduced for 5th years and if you (or your parents) take out private loans and don’t report them properly then they can look like income and reduce your Pell. Basically, go talk to your financial aid office. They can help you file an addendum, find more grants, or find new scholarships/stipends. I suggest EVERYONE in school do this because there are often lots of resources people just don’t know about. Be kind, explain your situation, and be willing to do your own research or leg work afterwards when they point you into the right direction. Your “advice” is dangerous. Graduates should DEFINITELY be saving up for when they graduate. Moving ALONE can cost you thousands of dollars, especially moving to either a HCOL area for work or moving cross country. Plus many graduates don’t find a full-time job for months after graduating. Good on you for being prudent enough to put together a small savings.","Assistant

"19, got my first consistent and decent paying job. I want to now do the right things and have the most money later down the line. Where and how do I begin to invest?","I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice: As you've mentioned, agree with clearing your debt first to stop bleeding interest on them. If you don't have a budget it'll be helpful if you made one to ear mark what part of your salary is for what. New challenger app based banks are good for this, I know Monzo lets you categorise your spending and you can put a budget on each category (eg groceries, leisure, bills). I hope other banks have the same feature. For enjoying some of your money, a popular method is to budget for a certain amount of guilt free spending money each month. ISAs are great for their tax free gains. Cash ISA pay you interest for parking your money with them. Stocks and shares ISA protects your capital gains when you sell shares that have appreciated in value. There are rules on how much you can put into ISAs every tax year (one of each type, £20k total across all of them), suggest you do some research and see if they'll suit you. There are currently generous annual tax free allowances for interest (£500) / capital gains (£12. 3k) outside of an ISA so you might not need ISAs. But tax free gains are tax free forever, and there is a limit of how much you can put into ISAs that expires every year (£20k) so it might be worth getting the ball rolling on your ISAs. You may have come across Lifetime ISA (LISA) before, that locks away your money until you're 55 (I think?) or for a house purchase so it doesn't seem to be useful for the goals you listed. Investments are generally considered safer in longer time frames, usual figure is 5 to 10 years or more. If you want to access your money within 5 years there is a chance you'll get back less than you invested. Well done on reaching out to get better at finances. Recommend you always do your own research and make informed decisions, instead of listening to random people on the internet. Good luck stranger :).","Assistant

Father dying in hospital. Need some advice.,"This same thing happened to my partner a few years ago, when we were in our mid-twenties. Here are a few tips we discovered along the way that saved us: - Hire an estate lawyer right away. Go talk to them immediately (although remember they will likely charge by the hour) and make a list of things you will need to do. Your father’s estate will need to go through probate court to officially transfer things over to you, you want a lawyer to handle all of that. - Get organized. We kept a giant, three-ring binder with all of our paperwork in it (copies of tax records, home records, will, whatever else you end up with). Even now, several years later, we pull that thing out every now and then when we need it. We also had a google doc with all the important numbers we kept needing to know—birth date, social security, address, etc. Super helpful. We also kept a google doc list of his friends, important people and their contact information. That was helpful when arranging things like a funeral, or just reaching out for whatever reason. - Hire someone to do your taxes this year (when you get all his assets, it’ll be interesting) and his final taxes. Those were the big ones that really helped us. You will get through it, be gentle on yourself and take your time. Probate can take forever, but that’s okay. Besides some things that need to happen right away, there isn’t really a rush after that. Good luck.","Assistant

So, DTC Pay Method: Stock Dividend should match with Processed As: Stock Dividend. ) Of course, one might ask why there are two fields that should be the same all the time? Well, it does open the possibility for a mismatch, yeah? For example, DTC could try to pull a Processed As: Stock Dividend with Pay Method: Stock Split. Alternatively, and this may be more common with Payments In Lieu, Event Type: Stock Split to be Processed As: Stock Dividend with DTC Pay Method: Cash. This mix would allow for stock splits in the form of stock dividends to actually be paid out in Cash using the Dividend Payments in Lieu \, \].

Curious as to why so many 18 year olds are getting tossed from parent's house on short notice (per numerous posts here) - advice here too.,"I think a lot of posters are reluctant to give the full details. When they don't give a reason, the reason probably doesn't make them look good. I definitely doubt the situations were completely out of the blue. Even if the parents were just wanting their kids to move out at 18 no matter what, it wouldn't make sense to hide it from their kids. My parents made it clear that once we turned 18, we needed to either pay rent or be in school full time to stay at the house. My brother dropped out of school his first semester and was told to pay up or leave. He left and he often calls it being ""kicked out"". I left at 18 despite being in school just because I wanted to live on my own. I honestly think it's good for young adults to feel that stress and have to work to make ends meet.

The attack we witnessed over the last few days was only possible because bitcoin mining has become too centralized. Core needs to take action.,"Mining power didn't shift away because it was centralized. Mining power shifted away because another coin with the same algo was more profitable to mine. MOST miners made the rational, correct choice to maximise their profits by switching to the more profitable coin. Changing the algo won't actually prevent that scenario from re-occurring. Changing the DAA won't either, though it would allow BTC to adapt more quickly to rapid hash swings (though at the potential loss of the reasons for the 2-week period having been set in the first place). Altcoins that share a PoW deal with the same issue, with the caveat that they don't care how insecure their chains have become when they lose massive amounts of hash-power because they are all low profile coins. Honestly I've been wondering if some kind of block reward change that favors loyalty would be plausible. No change to the expected long term payouts statistically, but some kind of lookback on previously mined blocks so that the block reward is spread amongst the payout addrs of the last x mined blocks rather than entirely to the current block. It would essentially create a payout ""ramp up"" when you come back to mining BTC, which would effectively punish miners who abandon the chain in search of short-term profitability. I dunno though I haven't thought this through carefully at all, just spit-balling.","Assistant
I agree that it's time for an update in how Bitcoin is mined; however I don't think this means shutting down any of our hardware or creating central pools like BTC China did when they were forced out by regulators (and then promptly shuttered).

Strap in; the impending housing and banking implosion.,"You've missed a lot of nuance, i. E. 1. Negative gearing doesn't mean that the property has to be cashflow negative. Remember you can also just amp up depreciation and also ""maintenance"" expenses. These have to be taken off the cost base when you sell, but it's in your interests to convert a present figure into a concessionally taxed deferred figure. In other words, some of NG can be ""paper losses"" that are strategically maximised. 2. A lot of the people who are unemployed casuals were not exactly in the market for a property anyway. 3. A lot of ""mortgage stress"" indices are based on self-reporting, which isn't always helpful. For example, I put 75% of my after-tax income into my mortgage. That far exceeds the 30% figure usually thrown around. But I don't feel stressed about it at all. I just choose to make extra payments. Having said all that, I do think property is in line for a correction - and about time, too. I don't intend on buying another IP at the current over-inflated prices.

Banks promote their own products like savings accounts or checking services because they offer relatively low returns compared to other investment options while also providing basic banking features at an affordable cost for customers who don't need sophisticated investments beyond those offered by the bank itself (e.g., no brokerage fees).

Why stocks keep moving higher. And higher. And higher.,Just my dumb theory but it wouldn't surprise me if we later find out that large institutional investors are borrowing money at low interest and pumping it into the stock market. This whole economy seems to be a house of cards. I own a small business and the number of credit card payment defaults are the highest they have been in 20 years. People are living paycheck to paycheck and are being squeezed in every direction. The tariffs are effecting people in an insidious way that they don't even notice. Every item in my store has gone up 20-25% in the last two years. I think that there has been this mass hypnosis that the economy is good. People are afraid to admit that they are not doing so well so they just spend and act as if this amazing economy is going to catch up to them eventually.,"Assistant
Stocks tend to move in trends that last for weeks or months at time before reversing direction due largely on market sentiment as well how much of the stock is available compared with demand which can cause prices too go up when there isn't enough supply but then fall back down if more supplies become accessible so they're going through cycles right now we have this thing called inflation where money has less purchasing power over here while other places like china aren’t seeing it yet eventually though you would expect them all together since trade happens between those two countries most recently some investors got scared off by rising rates from japan after their central bank raised its key rate three.",0.23741007194244607,0.014492753623188408,0.07913669064748201,0.00559087838631914,123,4,False,1,4.894308943089431,True,True
Who are the largest wealth creators?,"I wouldn't discuss this in terms of ""wealth"", but in terms of value. When people talk about ""value for money"" what they are really talking about is how their money translates into the goods or services that they desire, and then how these goods or services fulfill the needs or wants that they have. At the end of the day, you convert your time into money with a job. This is based on your salary, so if someone earns more than you for the same amount of time, even though the loaf of bread still costs £1, it costs you more than it costs them, because of the time conversion. This then means that each and every person has a ""relative cost"" they incur each and every time they consume. So often, even if you aren't producing ""original value"" items (goods or services that translate directly to the needs or desires of consumers) if you are able to effect the relative costs of the value, you are still contributing to the system. Essentially, we are all affecting everything around us, and it either contributes or costs according to absolute or relative value. The value of money, for example, is greatly ignored by the vast majority of the population, but if your wage doesn't at least match inflation, you are actually losing value. That is why I am so skeptical about the system, because I believe that in general, the people who have so much money that they can actually use their money(value) to create more money(value) then devalue the money that is already in the system - and I believe it is deliberate, so that people can't become powerful and free themselves simply by saving. To be honest, most people never even get to that stage, because before you save, you usually concentrate on cutting costs, the main one being houses. And ofc most people don't own their own home for the vast majority of their life. So its an ongoing treadmill.","Assistant

UK wage growth picks up in January but fails to keep pace with inflation Office for National Statistics says annual pay grew by 4. 3% in three months to December.,My work are not offering anything like inflation matching pay rises. They just think that people should be happy to have a job. I've been helping people get new jobs at other companies for big rises. I look forward to seeing the Q1 and Q2 attrition values.,"Assistant
It sounds like UK wages increased modestly during the third quarter of last year while still being outpaced largely unchanged over time due primarily on rising costs from higher energy prices as well other factors including housing cost increases which were partially offsetted somewhat through lower food expenditures according some data sources though this was not captured here specifically it's worth noting that these changes could be more nuanced than what is presented at face value especially when you consider how much people spend their money differently across different types or categories so those numbers should really just serve mainly only as an approximation rather then anything close enough where one can say they're actually accurate given all kinds if nuances going into.",0.16091954022988506,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.002690663249897347,124,0,False,1,5.475806451612903,True,True

Anyone else mentally exhausted and confused trying to become consistent?,"Yes I do feel mentally drained. I’ve had months where I make 6 figure profits and then others where I can’t seem to get a single trade correct. If you’re like most traders, the problem is not the technicals but the constant struggle with that inner voice that’s telling you to hold on to gains or get back what you already lost. What I believe is that you have to detach yourself from what money is and what money represents. You can’t look at 1000 dlrs for what you can buy with it otherwise you’ll go crazy trading the markets and it will lead you to poor decision making leading to losing trades. If you can manage to do that you can automatically conquer the psychological aspect of trading. At the end of the day it’s only units. Outside in the real world they’re worth something but in our accounts it’s nothing but an electronic number. I’ve noticed that whenever I’m more in tune with that idea, I become more consistent.","Assistant

I moved all my money over to Wealthsimple and now I am too scared to actually buy anything. New to this- please be kind.,"You are making this too complicated, thus making you stressed. 1: Stick to VGRO/XGRO or XEQT/VEQT if you want 100% equities. 2: make a plan for buying. Let's say you invest 1/8 every month until December. Stick to it. 3: after a year or two, when you have more experience, you can always sell VGRO and buy something else. Very easy. That's what I did with my mother last weekend. She inherited 40k, wanted to start investing herself. Showed her the 2,5% fee she was paying with her institution. She will buy a 50/50 mix of XAW/XIU, 1/8 every month until December. She chose her own % of XAW/XIU, she's retired and her government pension is enough to cover everything right now.

Ben Felix Proposed Five-Factor ETF Model Portofolio.,"Note that this portfolio is designed for Canadians. XIC in particular is Canadian stocks, so Americans might want to allocate that to the US (and probably a bit to international, since there's already a lot of US in the portfolio), and people from other countries may want to allocate the 30% to their home country/region. The other three funds are also in Canadian currency. The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM. Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now. The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them. It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF). So: * 30% XIC * 30% VUN * 10% AVUV * 16% XEF * 8% XEC * 6% AVDV I'm really glad you posted this, because even ignoring the factor aspect, most forecasts suggest US equities are expensive right now and call for international to outperform over the next decade. The past decade US outperformed, but the previous decade international outperformed. Diversification is key to consistent returns. Ben also put out a paper on expected returns:.","Assistant

"JP Morgan spoofed their earnings to get investors interested, then sells $13 Billion in bonds to keep them afloat during the MOASS.","A related anecdote: I hold some of my GME shares with JP Morgan Chase. I was on the phone with them the other day making sure my shares weren’t being lent out; they weren’t. However, I also asked about restrictions on placing limit orders. Apparently you can’t set limit orders at any higher than some percentage (I think it was 10%?) above market value using their software - you have to speak to a senior investment advisor. The customer service rep I was speaking with was surprised, as he didn’t know about it. He put me on hold to confer with higher-ups. He came back and said this was a new restriction, placed late January/early February (!) in response to market volatility (!!!!!) I asked him to explain the reasoning here, because it seemed directly in conflict with the interests of their clients. Market volatility means bigger price movements, meaning traders should want to be able to set higher limit orders under these conditions, as they’d be more likely to be filled. Limiting the sell orders makes it harder for their clients to capitalize on the volatility. I wanted an explanation. He said they’d get back to me via email. They haven’t.","Assistant

A personal tale of why active brokers can be the worst.,"This post will probably get a ton of upvotes because but as a broker/advisor myself, the advisor didn't make any mistakes here except not educating you on what you own and why you own it. Some mutual funds are going to have a higher expense ratio. An emerging markets or international fund is going to require more leg work to run so it will be more expensive. The main reason to hire a broker is to manage your money because you don't have the time and inclination to do it yourself. If you have the time and want to start learning, then definitely don't pay someone to do it for you (like you recently realized). Also realize a broker isn't there to teach you how to do it yourself. A plumber doesn't come out to your house to fix your pipes and teach you how to be a plumber.","Assistant

Scientific principle: Collective DD is much more reliable as any single DD! That's why our overall thesis is very likely to be true!,"Agree, but with one caveat. Peer review is only as successful as the peers. Our sub is highly biased toward confirmation bias so dissenting opinions tend to get drowned out. It’s something to keep in mind and in order to avoid it we need to hold everyone accountable by asking for sources and doing our own research to see if the conclusions drawn are reasonable. Many people are taking this the wrong way. I just want everyone to approach DD with healthy skepticism. Question everything, even those things that support our thesis or are believed to be cannon. If there isn’t an answer it could lead us down a path to the next god-tier DD.","Assistant

Their recent innovation with their silicon is off the charts and should make holders of intel, AMD, and NVDA very worried. The growth in their services revenue is such an impressive pivot.
