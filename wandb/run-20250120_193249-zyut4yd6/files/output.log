/home/zahemen/miniconda3/envs/transformer_LM/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/_dynamo/eval_frame.py:632: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: the use_reentrant parameter should be passed explicitly. In version 2.5 we will raise an exception if use_reentrant is not passed. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.
