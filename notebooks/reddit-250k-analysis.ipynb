I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \\n\\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?\", 'z_score': 34.13125953284077, 'normalized_score': 1.0, 'subreddit': 'finance', 'body': '(relix already hit on some of this)\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... \\n\\nAll actual \"money\" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don\\'t argue with me yet, I\\'ll get to that.)\\n\\nImagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let\\'s invent paper money. You can\\'t just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let\\'s walk through this...\\n\\n- Let\\'s say you\\'re an apple-farmer and I\\'m a hunter. You want some meat but haven\\'t harvested your crops yet. You say to me, \"hey, go hunt me some meat and I\\'ll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall\". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There\\'s probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard \"prices\" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. \\n\\n- Now, let\\'s say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  \"Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?\" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money. \\n\\n- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn\\'t even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest. \\n\\nNow, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The \"money\" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it\\'s transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere. \\n\\nSo far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we\\'ll address separately:\\n\\n- What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn\\'t \"go\" anywhere, it\\'s just gone, it doesn\\'t exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We\\'ll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). \\n\\n- The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn\\'t find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been \"destroyed\" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn\\'t exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.\\n\\nThe above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. \\n\\nAfter the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let\\'s say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won\\'t get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold. \\n\\nNow we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern \"bond\"...\\n\\n(continued in a reply to this post...)\\n\\n', 'comment_normalized_score': 1.0, 'combined_score': 2.0}\n"

      "[\"Honest question.\\n\\nWhere is all the money?  I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.\\n\\nPeople haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. \\n\\nSo where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \\n\\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?\"\n",
      " 'So often someone will ask an amazing question, something I’m really interested in getting a good answer to, or even someone’s opinion, but I always just see that message explaining that comments need to be approved. \\n\\n99.9% is an exaggeration, but not many people are going to come back to look at a post to see if any comments have been approved.'\n",
      " 'This is a throwaway account (I\\'m a longtime redditor under another login). /r/economics might not be the correct place to put this, but it was the best I could think of. I\\'m a mid-career guy in a business that does a lot of work with governmental and quasi-governmental agencies. I\\'ve never ripped anyone off personally, but I have seen and occasionally been an incidental beneficiary of quite a bit of patronage, insider dealing, nepotism, misuse of taxpayer money, and outright corruption. While I have always been honest in my own dealings on a case-by-case basis, I have refrained from many opportunities to be a \"whistleblower\".\\n\\nA lot of stuff on reddit misunderstands the relationships between wealth, power, and influence. For starters, all the above three are always and have always been inter-related, and probably always will be. And that might not always be a bad thing: those who have risen to high levels of wealth are often pretty smart, and surprisingly often exceptionally honest. Those who rise to high levels of influence usually have some pretty good insight and talent in their area of expertise. Those who have acquired a lot of power tend to be good at accomplishing things that lots of people want to see happen. \\n\\nNone of which is purely democratic, nor even purely meritocratic, but there is a certain dose of both kind of baked into the cake: stuff like wealth or family connections only gets you so far in modern, developed, and relatively open and transparent societies such as the US. And while that can be pretty far by normal standards, at some point sunlight does shine through any crack, and outright robbery or complete incompetence is difficult to sustain indefinitely.\\n\\nBut there is an awful lot of low-level waste, patronage, and corruption that happens both in the private and in the public sector. \\n\\nWithout going ideological, the private sector in a free-ish market has a more immediate system of checks and balances if only because you have to actually persuade the end users to keep buying your stuff for the price you\\'re charging: if it\\'s no good, or if you are grossly over-charging, your customers will tend to catch on sooner or later. \\n\\nBut in the public sector, the \"consumer\" often has little choice... so-called \"market discipline\" is a lot more diffuse when you have a former-schoolteacher-or-real-estate-broker-turned city councilman whose job it is to disburse a multi-million-dollar street-paving contract or whatever. And neither the schoolteacher nor the real-estate broker has any clue how to write or evaluate a road-paving contract...\\n\\nLet\\'s say that there are three credible bidders for that street-paving contract: \\n\\n* Bidder 1 is \"Paver Joe\", a local guy with a driveway-paving company and three trucks who sees this as a big opportunity to expand his business and get the city to pay for five new trucks. He puts in a dirt-cheap bid that he wrote up himself with the help of his estate attorney. The cost to taxpayers is very low, but the certainty that he will complete it on schedule and as specified is a little iffy. Paver Joe plans to work overtime and bust his tail on the job, not for profits, but to grow his business. He\\'s offering the taxpayers a great deal, but a slightly risky one.\\n\\n* Bidder 2 is \"Muni Paver Inc\", a company who has the experience and expertise to do the job, who knows what\\'s involved and who has done this work before. They already have the trucks, their workers are all unionized and paid \"prevailing wage\", everything will be done by the book, all their EPA certifications are in place, etc... The bid is a lot more expensive than Paver Joe, but it\\'s credible and reliable. They are offering the taxpayers a degree of certainty and confidence that Paver Joe cannot match.\\n\\n* Bidder 3 is me, \"Corruptocorp\". Instead of Paver Joe\\'s 2-page contract with typos, or Muni-Paving\\'s 20-page contract, I\\'m offering the city council a full package of videos, brochures, and a 40-page contract with a price just a tad higher than Paver Joe (my quoted price is meaningless, as we will see). Moreover, I\\'m inviting the city council to Corruptocorp-owned suites in a golf resort near my headquarters to give my presentation (all expenses paid, of course, and of course, bring your spouses). There the city council members will, after the first day of golf, dinner, dancing, and cocktails, see a slideshow and chorus-line of smiling multi-ethnic faces and working mothers talking about how much Corruptocorp\\'s paving improved their town and their lives. I\\'ll then stand up and tell a self-effacing joke about being one of those corporate guys trying to get their money, and then I\\'ll wax a bit emotional about my small-town roots and how Corruptocorp was started by a man with a simple dream to make life better for everyone, and to do well by doing good in local communities, and that we actually plan to hire local contractors such as Joe\\'s Paving to do the work, backed our economies of scale and reliability. I\\'ll mention that paragraph 32 subsection B of our proposal mandates twice-yearly performance reviews by the city council, to of course be held at the golf resort, at Corruptocorp\\'s expense, (\"so I hope to see you all back here every February and August!\"), and of course I make sure that each of them has my \"personal\" cell phone and home numbers in case they have any questions....\\n\\nSo needless to say I get the bid, and six months later it\\'s time for our review at the golf resort. After dinner and cocktails I step up to the podium and announce that there is both good news and bad news: \\n\\n*\"The bad news is that our subcontractor has found over 1,000 rocks in the road. And as I\\'m sure you know, paragraph 339 subsection D.12 specifies that any necessary rock removal will be done at prevailing wages, currently $1,500 per rock, for a total cost overrun of $1.5 million. But the good news is (and believe me, I had to fight long and hard for this with the board of directors), Corruptocorp has agreed to remove those rocks for only $1,000 apiece! So even though there have been some cost overruns, your smart decisions have saved your taxpayers **half a million dollars**! Give yourselves a round of applause!\"*\\n\\n*\"Now, the other situation is that there has been some \\'difficult terrain\\' as described in subsection 238b, which I\\'m sure you\\'re all familiar with.  And as you know, \\'difficult terrain\\' is not covered by the contract, which is for paving, not for turning mountains into flat roads... (wistful chuckle). Now, technically, according to the contract, we should be charging your town prevailing rates for these sections, but I\\'ve worked it so that you will be allowed to re-bid them, if you wish, since our contract doesn\\'t specifically include terrain as described in subsection 238b.\"*\\n\\nNow the contract price has doubled, and Corruptocorp has completely sidestepped all of the difficult and costly work, taking profits only on the easy stuff. The city council members can either admit that they were duped and bought (political suicide), or can simply feed corruptocorp\\'s line to the voters. Which do you think will happen?\\n\\nAnd it gets even worse on smaller scales: look up your local building or electrical inspector. Ten-to-one he is a relative, friend, or campaign donor to the mayor or city council. What\\'s in it for him? Every single construction or home improvement project not only has to pay him a fee, it also has to pass his inspection. Guess which contractors are most likely to pass his inspection? His brothers, friends, family... or the cheapest guy who for some reason has a hard time finding work in this town? Guess how the local inspector feels about homeowner self-improvements: does he think they are a great way for regular people to improve their wealth with a little elbow grease, or does he see them as stealing work from his friends and family? \\n\\nThe US military is by far the most wasteful customer I\\'ve ever had. I\\'ll talk about that if this topic gets any interest. \\n\\nedit: as promised, here\\'s the post about military spending:\\n\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/c84bp/how_realworld_corruption_works/c0qrt6i'\n",

      " '(Bloomberg) -- Wealthsimple Inc., a commission-free Canadian online brokerage with more than 350,000 clients, is warning traders about the risks of investing in certain highly speculative stocks, but isn’t planning to halt trading in those shares.\\n\\nWealthsimple, whose motto is “get rich slow,” doesn’t offer riskier investment choices such as options trading or margin accounts, and has sent clients emails reminding them about the dangers of speculation, Chief Executive Officer Mike Katchen said in an interview with BNN Bloomberg Television Friday. It also embedded in-app notifications for users looking at certain stocks.\\n\\nThe firm doesn’t plan to restrict trading on those shares the way Robinhood Markets Inc. and other brokerages have done in recent days, Katchen said.\\n\\n“If people are taking calculated risks and want to join in on the fun, but are doing it in a responsible way with an amount of their portfolio that they can effectively lose if and when these stock prices do come down, that’s OK,” Katchen said. “But we want to make sure that people are being responsible, and we’re trying to be as proactive as we can about that messaging.”\\n\\nThe recent frenzy of retail trading has spurred a surge in interest even in the tamer platform of Wealthsimple, which touts passive investing in ETFs and is building out cash, checking, insurance and mortgage products. The company, owned by Power Corp. of Canada financial conglomerate, saw sign-ups increase more than 50% from a week earlier and daily volume more than double, Katchen said.\\n\\nThat surge in interest could be a good thing if handled properly, he said.\\n\\n‘Fine Line’\\n\\n“We have to walk that fine line of using this opportunity to bring more and more people into the capital markets and into the opportunity of investing,” he said. “But let’s also remember that investment carries risks, and it does require thoughtfulness and long-term thinking.”\\n\\nKatchen would like to see investors use individual stock-picking and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which his firm does allow trading in, as part of a “play money” account on the margins of their larger, core, long-term investing strategy. He also doesn’t see options and margin accounts as inherently wrong, but said they can be dangerous when used by new investors who don’t understand them.\\n\\n“The gamification of these highly risky tools is problematic and could result in some very bad outcomes for people, and we don’t want to be a part of that,” Katchen said.\\n\\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-answer-to-robinhood-warns-traders-but-won-t-halt-stocks-1.1556216'\n",
      " ' Hi all beginners, I was once like you, had no idea what I was doing, no idea what an option was, and had no idea how to even buy a stock. Now, you could say I\\'m an \"experienced\" trader (Whatever the f%&amp;\\\\* that means), and I see a decent amount of posts \"totally new - what should I invest in\". From all the smooth brains that have been doing this for awhile - that\\'s really annoying and no one wants to help you for the most part. \\n\\nInstead, do you own research first - I mean, you literally have Google, it is so simple. Im really not trying to bash on anyone, but Google is amazing and if you just take the 15 minutes to read an article or watch the ENTIRE youtube video, you will be so much further ahead. people are so obsessed with the known and dont want to work. It has taken me about 3-4 years to finally understand the market, charts, DD, and more about stocks and I still lose money on trades, and if u see someone saying they never loss money its a scam and stay away. Anyways, what im trying to preface this with is stocks take time to understand do you DD.\\n\\nFor those complete beginners that dont even have brokerage app installed yet, here are some good places to start:\\n\\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp) (investopedia in general is amazing for learning)\\n\\n[https://www.thebalance.com/stock-trading-101-358115](https://www.thebalance.com/stock-trading-101-358115) \\n\\nThose are two good articles to start reading, giving you a basic understanding. I know most of you wont read that so for complete beginners here is the TL;DR: FIND A BROKEAGE LIKE ROBINHOOD,WEBULL ETC, DEPOSIT MONEY, THEN ONCE THE MONEY HITS START RESEARCHING STOCKS YOU WANT TO BUY.\\n\\nSo now that you have a brokerage app installed on your phone, or you can access it via your laptop, doesnt matter, and you have some money in there, you can actually start buying the stocks. Depending on what brokerage you are using all the UIs look different so buying and selling will look different but buying and selling is the same. If you buy a stock you get shares, and when you sell the stock you lose those shares and \"collect\" your money, whether thats a profit or loss.\\n\\nAnyways, you have a brokerage now with some money in it, how do you find stocks to buy. There are a million difference ways you can decide. The first way I recommend you find stocks to buy is through create a \"stock screener\". [Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/) has a great free tool that alot of people use for this, and there are a ton of youtube videos on how to create your own screener..here are some of my favorite screeners:\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8sNMhPJINU&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8sNMhPJINU&amp;t=2s)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWpe30R2VnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWpe30R2VnM)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xKOo6vNaq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xKOo6vNaq8)\\n\\nEach morning, you can run these scans premarket and have some stock ideas on what you want to trade. But don\\'t just base your screener off of the stocks you are going to buy, you have to make sure they are a good stock with potential because just because its in your screener doesn\\'t mean it is a stock you want to trade. So go through technical chart analysis (will cover that further down), read up on the stock, look at the price target, with analysts think it is a good buy or if you should sell, you can look at the fundamentals, and much more. The good news is all of that can be found on Finviz as well. \\n\\nBefore we get into the meat of breaking down your pre-market screener stocks, there are some other ways you can check out stocks to buy. There are way to many accounts to count on twitter that provide great advise and tweet about what stocks they are watching and buying into - this is complete free. Another great place you can go is right here - REDDIT. People are always posting stock ideas, so instead of posting \"what should I buy\" take that time to look through subreddits of what people are buying, what they are looking at or some of the DDs, those can be super helpful.\\n\\nNow that you have an idea on how to find the stocks, the next part is determining if you should actually buy the stock or not. The first step I like is the technical chart analysis. If this is a swing trade, a stock you plan on holding for more than a day but less than a year, technical analysis is super important in my opinion. If you are LONG on a stock and are going to hold it for more than a year or even 10+ years then it is more about the company and the direction you think they will be going which is more fundamental trading, but I focus on more of the swing trading, and sometimes day trading but I dont really do that. Here are some good videos to understand technical analysis of a stock chart:\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlZRtQkfK04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlZRtQkfK04)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6hZma0bajE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6hZma0bajE)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItacPNRujiU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItacPNRujiU)\\n\\nThose are some great videos that should get you started and really will teach you what all the stuff on the charts mean so you can start to break down charts on your own and know if those stocks from your screener are worth buying or not.\\n\\nThe next analysis that is popular is called funamental, I dont do this style but here are 2 videos that cover it in good detail:\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a63yvv4vjDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a63yvv4vjDE)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baAzH5ZfNbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baAzH5ZfNbs)\\n\\nThere you have it. Now you can sign up for a broker to get money into an account, deposit money in, start screening for stocks that you may want to buy, and then review their chart to see if you want to buy the stock. \\n\\nIf it still seems confusing go back to what confuses you and re-read the article or find another video that may explain it better than the videos I found. Its all about just doing the process over and over again and you will see what works and what doesnt. That is the honest truth, like i said it took me about 3 years to find what works for me and what doesnt. And what works for me may not work for you, the biggest part of understanding a stock or the market in general is having your own way so you are confident when you invest in a stock.\\n\\nPro-tip, when you buy your stocks, set a stop loss order for the stock. This means that if the stock doesnt go up and starts falling, once it hits a certain price it will automatically sell. This is very important for managing your risk, especially as a beginner.\\n\\ncheck out this video on stop losses: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW7P22B\\\\_99A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW7P22B_99A)\\n\\nI hope you beginners learned something from this, if not no problem. drop your questions below I will try to answer, but again im now financal advisor or millionaire.'\n",
      " '&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 0. Preface\\n\\nI am not a financial advisor, and I do not provide financial advice. Many thoughts here are my opinion, and others can be speculative.\\n\\nTL;DR - **(Though I think you REALLY should consider reading because it is important to understand what is going on**):\\n\\n* The market crash of 2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have **still** been running rampant doing the **same** **bullshit in the derivatives market** as that market continues to be unregulated. They\\'re profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy. **Only this time it is much, much worse.**\\n* The bankers abused smaller amounts of leverage for the 2008 bubble and have since abused much higher amounts of leverage - creating an even larger speculative bubble. Not just in the stock market and derivatives market, but also in the crypt0 market, upwards of 100x leverage.\\n* COVID came in and rocked the economy to the point where the Fed is now pinned between a rock and a hard place. In order to buy more time, the government triggered a flurry of protective measures, such as mortgage forbearance, expiring end of Q2 on June 30th, 2021, and SLR exemptions, which expired March 31, 2021. **The market was going to crash regardless. GME was and never will be the reason for the market crashing.**\\n* The rich made a fatal error in **way** overshorting stocks. There is a potential for their decades of sucking money out of taxpayers to be taken back. The derivatives market is potentially a **$1 Quadrillion market**. \"Meme prices\" are not meme prices. There is so much money in the world, and you are just accustomed to thinking the \"meme prices\" are too high to feasibly reach.\\n* The DTC, ICC, OCC have been passing rules and regulations (auction and wind-down plans) so that they can easily eat up competition and consolidate power once again like in 2008. The people in charge, including Gary Gensler, are not your friends.\\n* The DTC, ICC, OCC are also passing rules to make sure that retail will **never** be able to to do this again. **These rules are for the future market (post market crash) and they never want anyone to have a chance to take their game away from them again**. These rules are not to start the MOASS. They are indirectly regulating retail so that a short squeeze condition can never occur after GME.\\n* The COVID pandemic exposed a lot of banks through the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) where mass borrowing (leverage) almost made many banks default. Banks have account \\'blocks\\' on the Fed\\'s balance sheet which holds their treasuries and deposits. **The SLR exemption made it so that these treasuries and deposits of the banks \\'accounts\\' on the Fed\\'s balance sheet were not calculated into SLR, which allowed them to boost their SLR until March 31, 2021 and avoid defaulting. Now, they must extract treasuries from the Fed in reverse repo to avoid defaulting from SLR requirements. This results in the reverse repo market explosion as they are scrambling to survive due to their mass leverage.**\\n* This is not a \"retail vs. Melvin/Point72/Citadel\" issue. This is a \"retail vs. **Mega Banks**\" issue. The rich, and I mean **all of Wall Street,** are trying **desperately** to shut GameStop down because it has the chance to suck out trillions if not hundreds of trillions from the game they\\'ve played for decades. They\\'ve rigged this game since the 1990\\'s when derivatives were first introduced. **Do you really think they, including the Fed, wouldn\\'t pull all the stops now to try to get you to sell?**\\n\\nEnd TL;DR\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA ton of the information provided in this post is from the movie **Inside Job (2010)**. I am paraphrasing from the movie as well as taking direct quotes, so please understand that a bunch of this information is a summary of that film.\\n\\nI understand that **The Big Short (2015)** is much more popular here, due to it being a more Hollywood style movie, but it does not go into such great detail of the conditions that led to the crash - and how things haven\\'t even changed. But in fact, got worse, and led us to where we are now.\\n\\nSeriously. **Go**. **Watch**. **Inside Job**. It is a documentary with interviews of many people, including those who were involved in the Ponzi Scheme of the derivative market bomb that led to the crash of 2008, and their continued lobbying to influence the Government to keep regulations at bay.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) Promotional](https://preview.redd.it/vvdd32qkei571.png?width=776&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=982445a99f17af054bd351990017e364b137cf02)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 1. The Market Crash Of 2008\\n\\n# 1.1 The Casino Of The Financial World: The Derivatives Market\\n\\nIt all started back in the 1990\\'s when the **Derivative Market** was created. This was the opening of the literal Casino in the financial world. These are bets placed upon an underlying asset, index, or entity, and are **very** risky. Derivatives are contracts between two or more parties that derives its value from the performance of the underlying asset, index, or entity.\\n\\nOne such derivative many are familiar with are **options** (CALLs and PUTs). Other examples of derivatives are **fowards**, **futures**, **swaps**, and variations of those such as **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)**, and **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**.\\n\\nThe potential to make money off of these trades is **insane**. Take your regular CALL option for example. You no longer take home a 1:1 return when the underlying stock rises or falls $1. Your returns can be amplified by magnitudes more. Sometimes you might make a 10:1 return on your investment, or 20:1, and so forth.\\n\\nNot only this, you can grab leverage by borrowing cash from some other entity. This allows your bets to potentially return that much more money. You can see how this gets out of hand really fast, because the amount of cash that can be gained absolutely skyrockets versus traditional investments.\\n\\nAttempts were made to regulate the derivatives market, but due to mass lobbying from Wall Street, regulations were continuously shut down. **People continued to try to pass regulations, until in 2000, the** [Commodity Futures Modernization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000) **banned the regulation of derivatives outright**.\\n\\nAnd of course, once the Derivatives Market was left unchecked, it was off to the races for Wall Street to begin making tons of risky bets and surging their profits.\\n\\nThe Derivative Market exploded in size once regulation was banned and de-regulation of the financial world continued. You can see as of 2000, the cumulative derivatives market was already out of control.\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.hilarispublisher.com\\\\/open-access\\\\/investment-banks-and-credit-institutions-the-ignored-and-unregulateddiversity-2151-6219-1000224.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/9igfmi69di571.png?width=578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27fefbf3443e8be528849221f2eadeb1a5c10833)\\n\\nThe Derivatives Market is big. **Insanely big**. Look at how it compares to **Global Wealth**.\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.visualcapitalist.com\\\\/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020\\\\/](https://preview.redd.it/s22atssgdi571.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=086dcebf3e710052f78b7490150203d0f8376b89)\\n\\nAt the bottom of the list are three derivatives entries, with \"Market Value\" and \"Notional Value\" called out.\\n\\nThe \"Market Value\" is the value of the derivative at its current trading price.\\n\\nThe \"Notional Value\" is the value of the derivative if it was at the strike price.\\n\\nE.g. A CALL option (a derivative) represents 100 shares of ABC stock with a strike of $50. Perhaps it is trading in the market at $1 per contract right now.\\n\\n* Market Value = 100 shares \\\\* $1.00 per contract = $100\\n* Notional Value = 100 shares \\\\* $50 strike price = $5,000\\n\\n**Visual Capitalist estimates that the cumulative Notional Value of derivatives is between $558 Trillion and $1 Quadrillion**. So yeah. **You** are not going to cause a market crash if GME sells for millions per share. The rich are already priming the market crash through the Derivatives Market.\\n\\n# 1.2 CDOs And Mortgage Backed Securities\\n\\nDecades ago, the system of paying mortgages used to be between two parties. The buyer, and the loaner. Since the movement of money was between the buyer and the loaner, the loaner was very careful to ensure that the buyer would be able to pay off their loan and not miss payments.\\n\\nBut now, it\\'s a chain.\\n\\n1. Home buyers will buy a loan from the lenders.\\n2. The lenders will then sell those loans to Investment Banks.\\n3. The Investment Banks then combine thousands of mortgages and other loans, including car loans, student loans, and credit card debt to create complex derivatives called \"**Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO\\'s**)\".\\n4. The Investment Banks then pay Rating Agencies to rate their CDO\\'s. This can be on a scale of \"AAA\", the best possible rating, equivalent to government-backed securities, all the way down to C/D, which are junk bonds and very risky. **Many of these CDO\\'s were given AAA ratings despite being filled with junk**.\\n5. The Investment Banks then take these CDO\\'s and sell them to investors, including retirement funds, because that was the rating required for retirement funds as they would only purchase highly rated securities.\\n6. Now when the homeowner pays their mortgage, the money flows directly into the investors. The investors are the main ones who will be hurt if the CDO\\'s containing the mortgages begin to fail.\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) - Flow Of Money For Mortgage Payments](https://preview.redd.it/0xtaww3ydi571.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f448a113043b043243efd879f174493bd33423fe)\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.investopedia.com\\\\/ask\\\\/answers\\\\/09\\\\/bond-rating.asp](https://preview.redd.it/uyk9ms4fei571.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d61e9a0754b676e64a1f6c97277ba877e946fcb6)\\n\\n# 1.3 The Bubble of Subprime Loans Packed In CDOs\\n\\nThis system became a ticking timebomb due to this potential of free short-term gain cash. Lenders didn\\'t care if a borrower could repay, so they would start handing out riskier loans. The investment banks didn\\'t care if there were riskier loans, because the more CDO\\'s sold to investors resulted in more profit. And the Rating Agencies didn\\'t care because there were no regulatory constraints and there was no liability if their ratings of the CDO\\'s proved to be wrong.\\n\\nSo they went wild and pumped out more and more loans, and more and more CDOs. Between 2000 and 2003, the number of mortgage loans made each year nearly quadrupled. They didn’t care about the quality of the mortgage - they cared about maximizing the volume and getting profit out of it.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s there was a huge increase in the riskiest loans - “Subprime Loans”. These are loans given to people who have low income, limited credit history, poor credit, etc. They are very at risk to not pay their mortgages. It was predatory lending, because it hunted for potential home buyers who would never be able to pay back their mortgages so that they could continue to pack these up into CDO\\'s.\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) - &amp;#37; Of Subprime Loans](https://preview.redd.it/wsr30iorei571.png?width=1447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59cf72f6eb8209d69e0a13ccf2f0127e69a45142)\\n\\nIn fact, the investment banks **preferred** subprime loans, because they carried higher interest rates and more profit for them.\\n\\n**So the Investment Banks took these subprime loans, packaged the subprime loans up into CDO\\'s, and many of them still received AAA ratings. These can be considered \"toxic CDO\\'s\" because of their high ability to default and fail despite their ratings.**\\n\\nPretty much **anyone** could get a home now. Purchases of homes and housing prices skyrocketed. It didn\\'t matter because everyone in the chain was making money in an unregulated market.\\n\\n# 1.4 Short Term Greed At The Risk Of Institutional And Economic Failure\\n\\nIn Wall Street, annual cash bonuses started to spike. Traders and CEOs became extremely wealthy in this bubble as they continued to pump more toxic CDO\\'s into the market. Lehman Bros. was one of the top underwriters of subprime lending and their CEO alone took home over $485 million in bonuses.\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) Wall Street Bonuses](https://preview.redd.it/io87r9vxei571.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=944300df8faf8da35d75de6f10fb951a6d230154)\\n\\nAnd it was all short-term gain, high risk, with no worries about the potential failure of your institution or the economy. When things collapsed, they would not need to pay back their bonuses and gains. They were literally risking the entire world economy for the sake of short-term profits.\\n\\nAND THEY EVEN TOOK IT FURTHER WITH LEVERAGE TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS.\\n\\nDuring the bubble from 2000 to 2007, the investment banks were borrowing heavily to buy more loans and to create more CDO\\'s. The ratio of banks borrowed money and their own money was their leverage. The more they borrowed, the higher their leverage. They abused leverage to continue churning profits. And are still abusing massive leverage to this day. It might even be much higher leverage today than what it was back in the Housing Market Bubble.\\n\\nIn 2004, Henry Paulson, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, helped lobby the SEC to relax limits on leverage, allowing the banks to sharply increase their borrowing. Basically, the SEC allowed investment banks to gamble a lot more. **Investment banks would go up to about 33-to-1 leverage at the time of the 2008 crash**. Which means if a 3% decrease occurred in their asset base, it would leave them insolvent. **Henry Paulson would later become the Secretary Of The Treasury from 2006 to 2009**. He was just one of many Wall Street executives to eventually make it into Government positions. Including the infamous Gary Gensler, the current SEC chairman, who helped block derivative market regulations.\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) Leverage Abuse of 2008](https://preview.redd.it/k87x53h7fi571.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b12004d6bb3e70643516ef0477303f4652ccd348)\\n\\nThe borrowing exploded, the profits exploded, and it was all at the risk of obliterating their institutions and possibly the global economy. Some of these banks knew that they were \"too big to fail\" and could push for bailouts at the expense of taxpayers. Especially when they began planting their own executives in positions of power.\\n\\n# 1.5 Credit Default Swaps (CDS)\\n\\nTo add another ticking bomb to the system, AIG, the worlds largest insurance company, got into the game with another type of derivative. They began selling Credit Default Swaps (CDS).\\n\\nFor investors who owned CDO\\'s, CDS\\'s worked like an insurance policy. An investor who purchased a CDS paid AIG a quarterly premium. If the CDO went bad, AIG promised to pay the investor for their losses. Think of it like insuring a car. You\\'re paying premiums, but if you get into an accident, the insurance will pay up (some of the time at least).\\n\\nBut unlike regular insurance, where you can only insure your car once, **speculators could also purchase CDS\\'s from AIG in order to bet against CDO\\'s they didn\\'t own**. You could suddenly have a sense of rehypothecation where fifty, one hundred entities might now have insurance against a CDO.\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) Payment Flow of CDS\\'s](https://preview.redd.it/7xoupx0ffi571.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=869beb0d99b9fbb4108cd5af692d0a6332fd52dd)\\n\\nIf you\\'ve watched The Big Short (2015), you might remember the Credit Default Swaps, because those are what Michael Burry and others purchased to bet against the Subprime Mortgage CDO\\'s.\\n\\nCDS\\'s were unregulated, so **AIG didn’t have to set aside any money to cover potential losses**. Instead, AIG paid its employees huge cash bonuses as soon as contracts were signed in order to incentivize the sales of these derivatives. But if the CDO\\'s later went bad, AIG would be on the hook. It paid everyone short-term gains while pushing the bill to the company itself without worrying about footing the bill if shit hit the fan. People once again were being rewarded with short-term profit to take these massive risks.\\n\\nAIG’s Financial Products division in London issued over $500B worth of CDS\\'s during the bubble. Many of these CDS\\'s were for CDO\\'s backed by subprime mortgages.\\n\\nThe 400 employees of AIGFP made $3.5B between 2000 and 2007. And the head of AIGFP personally made $315M. \\n\\n# 1.6 The Crash And Consumption Of Banks To Consolidate Power\\n\\nBy late 2006, Goldman Sachs took it one step further. It didn’t just sell toxic CDO\\'s, it started actively betting against them at the same time it was telling customers that they were high-quality investments.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs would purchase CDS\\'s from AIG and bet against CDO\\'s it didn’t own, and got paid when those CDO\\'s failed. Goldman bought at least $22B in CDS\\'s from AIG, and it was so much that Goldman realized AIG itself might go bankrupt (which later on it would and the Government had to bail them out). So Goldman spent $150M insuring themselves against AIG’s potential collapse. They purchased CDS\\'s against AIG.\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) Payment From AIG To Goldman Sachs If CDO\\'s Failed](https://preview.redd.it/m54zv03yfi571.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6cb605b4c9b36c22e60cd8205b80bd6ac770fac)\\n\\nThen in 2007, Goldman went even further. They started selling CDO\\'s specifically designed so that the more money their customers lost, the more Goldman Sachs made.\\n\\nMany other banks did the same. They created shitty CDO\\'s, sold them, while simultaneously bet that they would fail with CDS\\'s. All of these CDO\\'s were sold to customers as “safe” investments because of the complicit Rating Agencies.\\n\\nThe three rating agencies, Moody’s, S&amp;P and Fitch, made billions of dollars giving high ratings to these risky securities. Moody’s, the largest ratings agency, quadrupled its profits between 2000 and 2007. The more AAA\\'s they gave out, the higher their compensation and earnings were for the quarter. AAA ratings mushroomed from a handful in 2000 to thousands by 2006. Hundreds of billions of dollars worth of CDO\\'s were being rated AAA per year. When it all collapsed and the ratings agencies were called before Congress, the rating agencies expressed that it was “their opinion” of the rating in order to weasel their way out of blame. Despite knowing that they were toxic and did not deserve anything above \\'junk\\' rating.\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) Ratings Agencies Profits](https://preview.redd.it/tto0v644gi571.png?width=1332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4361dcc23801691d46ec88b241c7d5fa56e2aaf)\\n\\n[Inside Job \\\\(2010\\\\) - Insane Increase of AAA Rated CDOs](https://preview.redd.it/91dpnu78gi571.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f196573f47a757a8bcca8b9e712c537be84cbe2)\\n\\nBy 2008, home foreclosures were skyrocketing. Home buyers in the subprime loans were defaulting on their payments. Lenders could no longer sell their loans to the investment banks. And as the loans went bad, dozens of lenders failed. The market for CDO\\'s collapsed, leaving the investment banks holding hundreds of billions of dollars in loans, CDO\\'s, and real estate they couldn’t sell. Meanwhile, those who purchased up CDS\\'s were knocking at the door to be paid.\\n\\nIn March 2008, Bear Stearns ran out of cash and was acquired for $2 a share by JPMorgan Chase. The deal was backed by $30B in emergency guarantees by the Fed Reserve. This was just one instance of a bank getting consumed by a larger entity.\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.history.com\\\\/this-day-in-history\\\\/bear-stearns-sold-to-j-p-morgan-chase](https://preview.redd.it/gbgc30vlhi571.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74def34d1783c5e3195492913370e6ae65670301)\\n\\nAIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, were all AA or above rating days before either collapsing or being bailed out. Meaning they were \\'very secure\\', yet they failed.\\n\\nThe Fed Reserve and Big Banks met together in order to discuss bailouts for different banks, and they decided to let Lehman Brothers fail as well.\\n\\nThe Government also then took over AIG, and a day after the takeover, asked the Government for $700B in bailouts for big banks. At this point in time, **the person in charge of handling the financial crisis, Henry Paulson, former CEO of Goldman Sachs**, worked with the chairman of the Federal Reserve to force AIG to pay Goldman Sachs some of its bailout money at 100-cents on the dollar. Meaning there was no negotiation of lower prices. **Conflict of interest much?**\\n\\nThe Fed and Henry Paulson also forced AIG to surrender their right to sue Goldman Sachs and other banks for fraud.\\n\\n**This is but a small glimpse of the consolidation of power in big banks from the 2008 crash. They let others fail and scooped up their assets in the crisis.**\\n\\n**After the crash of 2008, big banks are more powerful and more consolidated than ever before. And the DTC, ICC, OCC rules are planning on making that worse through the auction and wind-down plans where big banks can once again consume other entities that default.**\\n\\n# 1.7 The Can-Kick To Continue The Game Of Derivative Market Greed\\n\\nAfter the crisis,  the financial industry worked harder than ever to fight reform. The financial sector, as of 2010, employed over 3000 lobbyists. More than five for each member of Congress. Between 1998 and 2008 the financial industry spent over $5B on lobbying and campaign contributions. And ever since the crisis, they’re spending even more money.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama campaigned heavily on \"Change\" and \"Reform\" of Wall Street, but when in office, nothing substantial was passed. But this goes back for decades - the Government has been in the pocket of the rich for a long time, both parties, both sides, and their influence through lobbying undoubtedly prevented any actual change from occurring.\\n\\nSo their game of playing the derivative market was green-lit to still run rampant following the 2008 crash and mass bailouts from the Government at the expense of taxpayers.\\n\\nThere\\'s now more consolidation of banks, more consolidation of power, more years of deregulation, and over a decade that they used to continue the game. And just like in 2008, it\\'s happening again. We\\'re on the brink of another market crash and potentially a global financial crisis.\\n\\n# \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 2. The New CDO Game, And How COVID Uppercut To The System\\n\\n# 2.1 Abuse Of Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities\\n\\nIt\\'s not just /u/atobitt\\'s \"House Of Cards\" where the US Treasury Market has been abused. It is abuse of many forms of collateral and securities this time around.\\n\\nIt\\'s the **same thing** as 2008, but much worse due to even higher amounts of leverage in the system on top of massive amounts of liquidity and potential inflation from stimulus money of the COVID crisis.\\n\\nHere\\'s an excerpt from [The Bigger Short: Wall Street\\'s Cooked Books Fueled The Financial Crisis of 2008. It\\'s Happening Again](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/):\\n\\n&gt;A longtime industry analyst has uncovered creative accounting on a startling scale in the commercial real estate market, in ways similar to the “liar loans” handed out during the mid-2000s for residential real estate, according to financial records examined by the analyst and reviewed by The Intercept. A recent, large-scale academic study backs up his conclusion, **finding that banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have systematically reported erroneously inflated income data that compromises the integrity of the resulting securities.**  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;...  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The analyst’s findings, first reported by ProPublica last year, are the subject of a whistleblower complaint he filed in 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the analyst has identified complex financial machinations\\xa0by one financial institution, one that both issues loans and manages a real estate trust, that may\\xa0ultimately\\xa0help one of its top tenants — the low-cost, low-wage store Dollar General — flourish while devastating smaller retailers.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;This time, the issue is not a bubble in the housing market, **but apparent widespread inflation of the value of commercial businesses, on which loans are based.**  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;...  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**Now it may be happening again** — this time not with residential mortgage-backed securities, based on loans for homes, **but commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, based on loans for businesses.** And this industrywide scheme is colliding with a collapse of the commercial real estate market amid the pandemic, which has **business tenants across the country unable to make their payments.**\\n\\nThey\\'ve been abusing Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) this time around, and potentially have still been abusing other forms of collateral - they might still be hitting MBS as well as treasury bonds per /u/atobitt\\'s DD.\\n\\nJohn M. Griffin and Alex Priest released a study last November. They sampled almost 40,000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019. **Their findings were that large banks had 35% or more loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatements.**\\n\\nThe below chart shows the overstatements of the biggest problem-making banks. The difference in bars is between samples taken from data between 2013-2015, and then data between 2016-2019. Almost every single bank experienced a positive move up over time of overstatements.\\n\\n&gt;Unintentional overstatement should have occurred at random times. Or if lenders were assiduous and the overstatement was unwitting, one might expect it to diminish over time as the lenders discovered their mistakes. **Instead, with almost every lender, the overstatement** ***increased*** **as time went on**. - [Source](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/theintercept.com\\\\/2021\\\\/04\\\\/20\\\\/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital\\\\/](https://preview.redd.it/5xmcu9hwhi571.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66f636574bd66afd3512b9587981e4caaa381cf3)\\n\\nSo what does this mean? **It means they\\'ve once again been handing out subprime loans (predatory loans). But this time to businesses through Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities.**\\n\\nJust like Mortgage-Backed Securities from 2000 to 2007, the loaners will go around, hand out loans to businesses, and rake in the profits while having no concern over the potential for the subprime loans failing.\\n\\n# 2.2 COVID\\'s Uppercut Sent Them Scrambling\\n\\nThe system was propped up to fail just like from the 2000-2007 Housing Market Bubble. Now we are in a speculative bubble of the entire market along with the Commercial Market Bubble due to continued mass leverage abuse of the world. \\n\\nHell - also in Crypt0currencies that were introduced after the 2008 crash. **Did you know that you can get over 100x leverage in crypt0 right now? Imagine how terrifying that crash could be if the other markets fail.**\\n\\nThere is SO. MUCH. LEVERAGE. ABUSE. IN. THE. WORLD. All it takes is one fatal blow to bring it all down - **and it sure as hell looks like COVID was that uppercut to send everything into a death spiral.**\\n\\nWhen COVID hit, many people were left without jobs. Others had less pay from the jobs they kept. It rocked the financial world and it was so unexpected. Apartment residents would now become delinquent, causing the apartment complexes to become delinquent. Business owners would be hurting for cash to pay their mortgages as well due to lack of business. The subprime loans all started to become a really big issue.\\n\\nDelinquency rates of Commercial Mortgages started to **skyrocket** when the COVID crisis hit. They even surpassed 2008 levels in March of 2020. Remember what happened in 2008 when this occurred? **When delinquency rates went up on mortgages in 2008, the CDO\\'s of those mortgages began to fail.

They could not allow these CDO\\'s to fail just yet, because they wanted to get their rules in place to help them consume other failing entities at a whim. \\n\\nLike in 2008, they wanted to not only protect themselves when the nuke went off from these decades of derivatives abuse, they wanted to be able to scoop up the competition easily. That is when the DTC, ICC, and OCC began drafting their auction and wind-down plans.\\n\\nIn order to buy time, they began tossing out emergency relief \"protections\" for the economy. Such as preventing mortgage defaults which would send their CDO\\'s tumbling. **This protection ends on June 30th, 2021**.\\n\\nAnd guess what? **Many people are still at risk of being delinquent**. [This article](https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/defusing-the-forbearance-time-bomb/) was posted just **yesterday**. The moment these protection plans lift, we can see a surge in foreclosures as delinquent payments have accumulated over the past year.\\n\\nWhen everyone, including small business owners who were attacked with predatory loans, begin to default from these emergency plans expiring, it can lead to the CDO\\'s themselves collapsing. **Which is exactly what triggered the 2008 recession**.\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.housingwire.com\\\\/articles\\\\/mortgage-forbearance-drops-as-expiration-date-nears\\\\/](https://preview.redd.it/b68fsf5aii571.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daa8c725185480d988802023a27291ee782b5c5f)\\n\\n# 2.4 SLR Requirement Exemption - Why The Reverse Repo Is Blowing Up\\n\\nAnother big issue exposed from COVID is when SLR requirements were leaned during the pandemic. They had to pass a quick measure to protect the banks from defaulting in April of 2020.\\n\\n&gt;In a brief announcement, the Fed said it would allow a change to the **supplementary leverage ratio to expire March 31**. The initial move, announced April 1, 2020, **allowed banks to exclude Treasurys and deposits with Fed banks from the calculation of the leverage ratio**. - [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/the-fed-will-not-extend-a-pandemic-crisis-rule-that-had-allowed-banks-to-relax-capital-levels.html)\\n\\nWhat can you take from the above? \\n\\n**SLR is based on the banks deposits with the Fed itself. It is the treasuries and deposits that the banks have on the Fed\\'s balance sheet. Banks have an \\'account block\\' on the Fed\\'s balance sheet that holds treasuries and deposits. The SLR pandemic rule allowed them to neglect these treasuries and deposits from their SLR calculation, and it boosted their SLR value, allowing them to survive defaults.**\\n\\nThis is a **big**, **big**, **BIG** sign that **the banks are way overleveraged by borrowing tons of money just like in 2008.**\\n\\nThe SLR is the \"Supplementary Leverage Ratio\" and they enacted quick to allow it so banks wouldn\\'t fail under mass leverage for failing to maintain enough equity.\\n\\n&gt;The supplementary leverage ratio is the US implementation of the Basel III Tier 1 **leverage ratio**, with which **banks calculate the amount of common equity capital they must hold relative to their total leverage exposure**. **Large US banks must hold 3%**. **Top-tier bank holding companies must also hold an extra 2% buffer, for a total of 5%**. The SLR, which does not distinguish between assets based on risk, is conceived as a backstop to risk-weighted capital requirements. - [Source](https://www.risk.net/definition/supplementary-leverage-ratio-slr)\\n\\n[Here is an exposure of their SLR](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/26/which-of-the-large-us-banks-is-most-leveraged.aspx) from earlier this year. The key is to have **high SLR, above 5%, as a top-tier bank**:\\n\\n|Bank|Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|JP Morgan Chase|6.8%|\\n|Bank Of America|7%|\\n|Citigroup|6.7%|\\n|Goldman Sachs|6.7%|\\n|Morgan Stanley|7.3%|\\n|Bank of New York Mellon|8.2%|\\n|State Street|8.3%|\\n\\nThe SLR protection ended on March 31, 2021. Guess what started to happen just after?\\n\\nT**he reverse repo market started to explode. This is VERY unusual behavior because it is not at a quarter-end where quarter-ends have significant strain on the economy. The build-up over time implies that there is significant strain on the market AS OF ENTERING Q2 (April 1st - June 30th).**\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\\\/series\\\\/RRPONTSYD](https://preview.redd.it/ijp4wkxdii571.png?width=1455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46f67d7efcc98ee475ba27fa41850fbf5d894064)\\n\\n**Speculation: SLR IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR DEPOSITS WITH THE FED ITSELF. THEY NEED TO EXTRACT TREASURIES OVER NIGHT TO KEEP THEM OFF THE FED\\'S BALANCE SHEETS TO PREVENT THEMSELVES FROM FAILING SLR REQUIREMENTS AND DEFAULTING DUE TO MASS OVERLEVERAGE. EACH BANK HAS AN ACCOUNT ON THE FED\\'S BALANCE SHEET, WHICH IS WHAT SLR IS CALCULATED AGAINST. THIS IS WHY IT IS EXPLODING. THEY ARE ALL STRUGGLING TO MEET SLR REQUIREMENTS.**\\n\\n# 2.5 DTC, ICC, OCC Wind-Down and Auction Plans; Preparing For More Consolidation Of Power\\n\\nWe\\'ve seen some interesting rules from the DTC, ICC, and OCC. For the longest time we thought this was all surrounding GameStop. Guess what. **They aren\\'t all about GameStop**. Some of them are, but not all of them.\\n\\n**They are furiously passing these rules because the COVID can-kick can\\'t last forever. The Fed is dealing with the potential of runaway inflation from COVID stimulus and they can\\'t allow the overleveraged banks to can-kick any more. They need to resolve this as soon as possible. June 30th could be the deadline because of the potential for CDO\\'s to begin collapsing.**\\n\\nLet\\'s revisit a few of these rules. The most important ones, in my opinion, because they shed light on the bullshit they\\'re trying to do once again: Scoop up competitors at the cheap, and protect themselves from defaulting as well.\\n\\n* **DTC-004:** Wind-down and auction plan. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/dtc/2021/34-91429.pdf)\\n* **ICC-005:** Wind-down and auction plan. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91806.pdf)\\n* **OCC-004:** Auction plan. Allows third parties to join in. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-91935.pdf)\\n* **OCC-003**: Shielding plan. Protects the OCC. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-92038.pdf)\\n\\nEach of these plans, in brief summary, allows each branch of the market to protect themselves in the event of major defaults of members. They also **allow members to scoop up assets of defaulting members**.\\n\\nWhat was that? Scooping up assets? **In other words it is more concentration of power**. **Less competition**.\\n\\nI would not be surprised if many small and large Banks, Hedge Funds, and Financial Institutions evaporate and get consumed after this crash and we\\'re left with just a select few massive entities. That is, after all, exactly what they\\'re planning for.\\n\\nThey could not allow the COVID crash to pop their massive speculative derivative bubble so soon. It came too sudden for them to not all collapse instead of just a few of them. It would have obliterated the entire economy even more so than it will once this bomb is finally let off. They needed more time to prepare so that they could feast when it all comes crashing down.\\n\\n# 2.6 Signs Of Collapse Coming - ICC-014 - Incentives For Credit Default Swaps\\n\\nA comment on this subreddit made me revisit a rule passed by the ICC. It flew under the radar and is another sign for a crash coming.\\n\\nThis is [ICC-014](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91922.pdf). Passed and effective as of June 1st, 2021.\\n\\nSeems boring at first. Right? That\\'s why it flew under the radar?\\n\\nBut now that you know the causes of the 2008 market crash and how toxic CDO\\'s were packaged together, and then CDS\\'s were used to bet against those CDO\\'s, check out what ICC-014 is doing **as of June 1st**.\\n\\n[ICC-014 Proposed Discounts On Credit Default Index Swaptions](https://preview.redd.it/phrxcouvii571.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=469560cf06458b51b1b5439d84062e9f6e04bda4)\\n\\n**They are providing incentive programs to purchase Credit Default Swap Indexes. These are like standard CDS\\'s, but packaged together like an index. Think of it like an index fund.**\\n\\n**This is allowing them to bet against a wide range of CDO\\'s or other entities at a cheaper rate. Buyers can now bet against a wide range of failures in the market. They are allowing upwards of 25% discounts.**\\n\\nThere\\'s many more indicators that are pointing to a market collapse. But I will leave that to you to investigate more. Here is quite a scary compilation of charts relating the current market trends to the crashes of Black Monday, The Internet Bubble, The 2008 Housing Market Crash, and Today.\\n\\n[Summary of Recent Warnings Re Intermediate Trend In Equities](https://preview.redd.it/y4reiv86hi571.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8845b7b90adf28409772483c6eeeef1763bbaaaf)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 3. The Failure Of The 1% - How GameStop Can Deal A Fatal Blow To Wealth Inequality\\n\\n# 3.1 GameStop Was Never Going To Cause The Market Crash\\n\\nGameStop was meant to die off. The rich bet against it many folds over, and it was on the brink of Bankruptcy before many conditions led it to where it is today.\\n\\nIt was never going to cause the market crash. And it never will cause the crash. The short squeeze is a result of high abuse of the derivatives market over the past decade, where Wall Street\\'s abuse of this market has primed the economy for another market crash on their own.\\n\\nWe can see this because when COVID hit, GameStop was a non-issue in the market. The CDO market around CMBS was about to collapse on its own because of the instantaneous recession which left mortgage owners delinquent.\\n\\nIf anyone, be it the media, the US Government, or others, try to blame this crash on GameStop or anything **other than the Banks and Wall Street**, **they are WRONG.**\\n\\n# 3.2 The Rich Are Trying To Kill GameStop. They Are Terrified\\n\\nIn January, the SI% was reported to be 140%. But it is very likely that it was **underreported at that time**. Maybe it was 200% back then. 400%. 800%. Who knows. From the above you can hopefully gather that Wall Street **takes on massive risks all the time, they do not care as long as it churns them short-term profits**. There is loads of evidence pointing to shorts never covering by hiding their SI% through malicious options practices, and manipulating the price every step of the way.\\n\\nThe conditions that led GameStop to where it is today is a miracle in itself, and the support of retail traders has led to expose a fatal mistake of the rich. **Because a short position has infinite loss potential**. There is SO much money in the world, especially in the derivatives market.\\n\\nThis should scream to you that any price target that **you** think is low, could very well be extremely low in **YOUR** perspective. You might just be accustomed to thinking \"$X price floor is too much money. There\\'s no way it can hit that\". I used to think that too, until I dove deep into this bullshit.\\n\\nThe market crashing no longer was a matter of simply scooping up defaulters, their assets, and consolidating power. The rich now have to worry about the potential of **infinite** losses from GameStop and possibly other meme stocks with high price floor targets some retail have.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a fight against Melvin / Citadel / Point72. **It\\'s a battle against the entire financial world**. There is even speculation from multiple people that the Fed is even being complicit right now in helping suppress GameStop. **Their whole game is at risk here.**\\n\\n**Don\\'t you think they\\'d fight tooth-and-nail to suppress this and try to get everyone to sell?**\\n\\n**That they\\'d pull every trick in the book to make you think that they\\'ve covered?**\\n\\nThe amount of money they could lose is unfathomable.\\n\\nWith the collapsing SI%, it is mathematically impossible for the squeeze to have happened - its mathematically impossible for them to have covered. /u/atobitt also discusses this in [House of Cards Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwaxv/house_of_cards_part_2/).\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.thebharatexpressnews.com\\\\/short-squeeze-could-save-gamestop-investors-a-third-time\\\\/](https://preview.redd.it/6hge0pxfhi571.png?width=871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab736cc279cc727524d2cf96384ea3e33109250)\\n\\nAnd in regards to all the other rules that look good for the MOASS - I see them in a negative light.\\n\\nThey are passing NSCC-002/801, DTC-005, and others, in order to prevent a GameStop situation from **ever** occurring again.\\n\\nThey realized how much power retail could have from piling into a short squeeze play. These new rules will snap new emerging short squeezes instantly if the conditions of a short squeeze ever occur again. There will **never** be a GameStop situation after this.\\n\\nIt\\'s their game after all. They\\'ve been abusing the derivative market game for decades and GameStop is a huge threat. It was supposed to be, \"crash the economy and run with the money\". Not \"crash the economy and pay up to retail\". But GameStop was a flaw exposed by their greed, the COVID crash, and the quick turn-around of the company to take it away from the brink of bankruptcy. \\n\\nThe rich are now at risk of losing that money and insane amounts of cash that they\\'ve accumulated over the years from causing the Internet Bubble Crash of 2000, and the Housing Market Crash of 2008.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I\\'m going to be fucking greedy.'\n",

If you don\\'t already know, the DTCC stands for Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation and is broken into the following (primary) subsidiaries:\\n\\n1. **Depository Trust Company (DTC)** \\\\- *centralized clearing agency that makes sure grandma gets her stonks and the broker receives grandma\\'s tendies*\\n2. **National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)** \\\\- *provides clearing, settlement, risk management, and central counterparty (CCP) services to its members for broker-to-broker trades*\\n3. **Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC)** \\\\- *provides central counterparty (CCP) services to members that participate in the US government and mortgage-backed securities markets*\\n\\n*Brief* *history* *lesson: I promise it\\'s relevant (this* [*link*](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/museum/index.html) *provides all the info that follows).*\\n\\nThe DTC was created in 1973. It stemmed from the need for a centralized clearing company. Trading during the 60s went through the roof and resulted in many brokers having to quit before the day was finished so they could manually record their mountain of transactions. All of this was done on paper and each share certificate was physically delivered. This obviously resulted in many failures to deliver (FTD) due to the risk of human error in record keeping. In 1974, the Continuous Net Settlement system was launched to clear and settle trades using a rudimentary internet platform.\\n\\nIn 1982, the DTC started using a [Book-Entry Only](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookentrysecurities.asp) (BEO) system to underwrite bonds. For the first time, there were no physical certificates that actually traded hands. Everything was now performed virtually through computers. Although this was advantageous for many reasons, it made it MUCH easier to commit a certain type of securities fraud- naked shorting.\\n\\nOne year later they adopted [NYSE Rule 387](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/retired-rules/rule-387) which meant most securities transactions had to be completed using this new BEO computer system. Needless to say, explosive growth took place for the next 5 years. Pretty soon, other securities started utilizing the BEO system. It paved the way for growth in mutual funds and government securities, and even allowed for same-day settlement. At the time, the BEO system was a tremendous achievement. However, we were destined to hit a brick wall after that much growth in such a short time.. By October 1987, that\\'s exactly what happened.\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n[*\"A number of explanations have been offered as to the cause of the crash...

A major factor behind the crash was a disconnect between the price of stock and their corresponding derivatives. The value of any given stock should determine the derivative value of that stock. It shouldn\\'t be the other way around. **This is an important concept to remember as it will be referenced throughout the post.**\\n\\nIn the off chance that the market DID tank, they hoped they could contain their losses with [portfolio insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolioinsurance.asp#:~:text=Portfolio%20insurance%20is%20a%20hedging,also%20refer%20to%20brokerage%20insurance)*.* Another [article from the NY times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/business/a-computer-lesson-from-1987-still-unlearned-by-wall-street.html) explains this in better detail. \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf6ocoe9abu61.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e638c4479aceac77a003ae86fa1cfdd23f5406b8\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8igwi6mflbu61.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=853945852aea5a355266bf52b6f1fa573db1e29a\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fe78gr1qlbu61.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec59987333e04cef07541229161b3ff30881444\\n\\nA major disconnect occurred when these futures contracts were used to intentionally tank the value of the underlying stock. In a perfect world, organic growth would lead to an increase in value of the company (underlying stock). They could  do this by selling more products, creating new technologies, breaking into new markets, etc. This would trigger an organic change in the derivative\\'s value because investors would be (hopefully) more optimistic about the longevity of the company. It could go either way, but the point is still the same. This is the type of investing that most of us are familiar with: investing for a better future.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to spend too much time on the crash of 1987. I just want to identify the factors that contributed to the crash and the role of the DTC as they transitioned from a manual to an automatic ledger system. **The connection I really want to focus on is the ENORMOUS risk appetite these investors had. Think of how overconfident and greedy they must have been to put that much faith in a computer script.. either way, same problems still exist today.**\\n\\nFinally, the comment by Bruce Bartlett regarding the mismatched investment strategies between stocks and options is crucial in painting the picture of today\\'s market.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s do a super brief walkthrough of the main parties within the DTC before opening this **can of worms.**\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nI\\'m going to talk about three groups within the DTC- **issuers, participants, and Cede &amp; Co.**\\n\\nIssuers are companies that issue securities (stocks), while participants are the clearing houses, brokers, and other financial institutions that can utilize those securities. Cede &amp; Co. is a subsidiary of the DTC which holds the share certificates.\\n\\nParticipants have MUCH more control over the securities that are deposited from the issuer. Even though the issuer created those shares, participants are in control when those shares hit the DTC\\'s doorstep. The DTC transfers those shares to a holding account *(Cede &amp; Co.)* and the participant just has to ask \"*May I haff some pwetty pwease wiff sugar on top?\"*  \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n**Now, where\\'s that can of worms?**\\n\\nEverything was relatively calm after the crash of 1987.... until we hit 2003..\\n\\n*\\\\*deep breath\\\\**\\n\\nThe DTC started receiving several requests from issuers to pull their securities from the DTC\\'s depository. I don\\'t think the DTC was prepared for this because they didn\\'t have a written policy to address it, let alone an official rule. Here\\'s the half-assed response from the DTC:\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.sec.gov\\\\/rules\\\\/sro\\\\/34-47978.htm \\\\(section II\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1ctpj263zdu61.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ff2e2d543f53a6ece6d95c334ed995fe67f9c8d)\\n\\nRealizing this situation was heating up, the DTC proposed [SR-DTC-2003-02](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm#P19_6635)..\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.sec.gov\\\\/rules\\\\/sro\\\\/34-47978.htm#P19\\\\_6635](https://preview.redd.it/io22id3n7eu61.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424ef5b6a70d073c62a47f6a1b82cd739b527b88)\\n\\nHonestly, they were better of WITHOUT the new proposal.\\n\\nIt became an even BIGGER deal when word got about the proposed rule change.

However... It is EXACTLY what Michael Sondow said in his comment letter above.. ***We simply cannot trust the DTC to protect our interests when we don\\'t have physical control of our assets***\\\\*\\\\*.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nSeveral other participants, including **Edward Jones, Ameritrade, Citibank,** and **Prudential** overwhelmingly favored this proposal.. How can someone NOT acknowledge that the absence of physical shares only makes it easier for these people to manipulate the market....?\\n\\nThis rule change would allow these \\'participants\\' to continue doing this because it\\'s extremely profitable to sell shares that don\\'t exist, or have not been collateralized. Furthermore, it\\'s a win-win for them because it forces issuers to keep their deposits in the holding account of the DTC...\\n\\nEver heard of the [fractional reserve banking system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp#:~:text=Fractional%20reserve%20banking%20is%20a,by%20freeing%20capital%20for%20lending)?? Sounds A LOT like what the stock market has just become.\\n\\nWant proof of market manipulation? Let\\'s fact-check the claims from the opposition letters above. *I\\'m only reporting a few for the time period we discussed (2003ish). This is just to validate their claims that some sketchy sh\\\\*t is going on.*\\n\\n1.

I\\'m not sure how to be any more objective about this.. Their entire FINRA report is littered with short sale violations. Before anyone asks \"how do you know they aren\\'t ALL like that?\" The answer is- I checked. If you get caught for a short sale violation, chances are you will ALWAYS get caught for short sale violations. Why? Because it\\'s more profitable to do it and get caught, than it is to fix the problem.\\n\\nWanna know the 2nd worst part?\\n\\nSeveral comment letters asked the DTC to investigate the claims of naked shorting **BEFORE** coming to a decision on the proposal..

This evolved into trading systems that were also computerized, but not as sophisticated as they hoped.. They played a major part in the 1987 crash, along with severely desynchronized derivatives trading.\\n\\nIn 2003, the DTC denied issuers the right to withdraw their deposits because those securities were in the control of participants, instead. When issuer A deposits stock into the DTC and participant B shorts those shares into the market, that\\'s a form of [rehypothecation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees). This is what so many issuers were trying to express in their comment letters. In addition, it hurts their company by driving down it\\'s value. They felt robbed because the DTC was blatantly allowing it\\'s participants to do this, and refused to give them back their shares..\\n\\nIt was critically important for me to paint that background.\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n..now then....\\n\\nRemember when I mentioned the DTC\\'s enrollee- Cede &amp; Co.?\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.sec.gov\\\\/rules\\\\/sro\\\\/34-47978.htm#P19\\\\_6635 \\\\(section II\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/97z3b2k9pju61.png?width=283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67ad209f338a0ccebfaee09cd43944730ac35279)\\n\\nI\\'ll admit it: I didn\\'t think they were that relevant.

According to his numbers, in most cases the short interest is 50% - 150% **MORE** than what is reported by the SEC *(starting at 14:30).* \\n\\nThe objective isn’t to address the issue: it’s to keep the issue hidden. Firms that underreport their short interest are gaming the system by taking advantage of how the short interest calculation is done. When the SEC relies on reports that broker-dealers provide, and FINRA takes YEARS to reveal the lies within those reports, the broker-dealer can lie without immediately facing the consequences. It allows these firms to operate in a high-risk environment without exposing just HOW big their risk-appetite is.\\n\\nAnother example that Wes mentioned was [Merrill Lynch](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-128.html). Merrill was fined [$415,000,000](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_16139.pdf) *(violation 3)* in 2016 for using securities held in their customer’s accounts to cover their own trades. Check out this screenshot I took from that case:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9625j8wek171.jpg?width=1115&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d43bc351fbda75e347bd33a1a550b67dda970e\\n\\nRemember when we mentioned [SEA 15c3-3](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/SEA.Rule_.15c3-3.pdf) in the case with Apex? They were asking customers to book short positions to either a cash account or a short margin account. [SEA 15c3-3](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/SEA.Rule_.15c3-3.pdf) protects those customers from allowing brokers to lend out the securities within their cash accounts…\\n\\nWell Merrill Lynch knocked that one right out of the f\\\\*cking park…\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3zok5wyek171.jpg?width=1129&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=815e5344912234ceba846dc0d45c8b8b488b82c4\\n\\nMerrill made it seem like the required deposit in their customer reserve account was much lower than it truly was. They wouldn’t have been able to use that cash if it reduced the amount below the minimum capital requirement, so they found a way to fudge the numbers. In doing so, they managed to prevent a CODE RED while reaping the benefits of a high-risk ‘opportunity’. Should Merrill have filed bankruptcy during that time, those customers would have been completely blindsided. \\n\\nIn the case of short selling, the *true* exposure of short interest is unknown… and I’m not just talking about the short sale indicator. When a firm fails to deliver securities that were sold short, there’s a pretty good indication that they’ve exposed themselves to a bit of a problem.. Now imagine a case where the FTDs start piling up and they STILL continue to short sell that same security.. think I’m joking?\\n\\nCheck out the [Royal Bank of Canada](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_31194.pdf):\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6yl6tj2fk171.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e44cc507247db1e28c00a213f90054b9abdaa6a\\n\\nAgain… I was pretty shocked at that one. However, nothing rang-the-bell quite like this one from [Goldman Sachs](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_361.pdf):\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5f408er6fk171.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38b9ad83d2a07360af5b5cd99d834a8771b66c93\\n\\nGoldman had 68 occasions in 4 months where they didn’t close a failure-to-deliver… In 45 occasions, they CONTINUED to accept customer short sale orders in securities which it had an active failure-to-deliver…\\n\\nWhen a firm is really starting to sweat, they pull certain tricks out of their ass to quell the situation. Again, this is nothing but smoke and mirrors because that’s all they can really do. Just as Merrill Lynch artificially lowered their customer reserve deposit, other firms make it look like they cover their short positions.\\n\\nOne of the ways they do this is by short selling a SH\\\\*T load of shares right before a buy-in… Since we’re talking about Goldman Sachs, this seems like a great time to showcase their experience with this..\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhf1hr1afk171.png?width=1049&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f704c3722ae287480057ce3e01c561a28b77cf4c\\n\\nI promise… It really is as dumb as it sounds…\\n\\nSo the perception here is when Goldman’s client has a FTD and they find out a buy-in is coming, the required buy-in would obviously be too extreme for the client to handle.. So they begin to buy those shares while simultaneously shorting AT LEAST the same amount they were required to purchase…\\n\\nHave you ever failed to repay a loan so you went to another bank and got a loan to cover the first one? Well that’s exactly what this is… I know what you’re probably thinking… “didn’t that just kick the can down the road?”. The answer is YES: it didn’t actually solve anything..\\n\\nThere’s still one more citation that Goldman received which truly represents the pinnacle of *no-sh\\\\*ts-given.* After I cover this, I don’t know how anyone could argue the systematic risks that exist within the securities lending business.. Check it out:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0md200bdfk171.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5e8310fbcbd73699e3593b2ab5dab418055ab0\\n\\nFor 5 years, Goldman relied on a team of 10-12 individuals to locate shares to be used by its clients for short selling. This group was known as the “demand team”. Naturally, as the number of requests coming in the door started to increase, it became difficult for the team to properly document all of them. The volume peaked at 20,000 requests PER DAY, but the number of individuals that handled this job stayed the same. \\n\\nObviously, this became too much for them to handle so they opted out of the manual process and found another solution- the F3 key….\\n\\nYes- the F3 key… This button activated an autofill system which completed **98% of Goldman’s orders to locate shares**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exqzge3gfk171.png?width=964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed9c8b740974dad01db69460332c56df81a8d768\\n\\nThe problem with Goldman’s autofill system was that it used the number of shares available to borrow at the beginning of that day, which had already been accounted for. After using the auto-locate feature, the demand team didn’t even verify the accuracy of the autofill feature or document which method was used to locate the shares for each order… and this happened for 5 years..\\n\\nJust goes to show how dedicated firms like Goldman Sachs truly are to the smallest of details, you know? Great f\\\\*cking work, guys.\\n\\nBy the way, I have to show one of Goldman’s short sale indicator violations… It’s too good to pass up.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5iuhlkcjfk171.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4e2fa1f106e78b9d282b60c3cee9944e919ea82\\n\\nAt some point, you just have to laugh at these ass clowns… I mean seriously… one violation for a 4 year period involving over 380,000,000 short interest positions… they have plenty of other short interest violations, I just laughed at how the magnitude of this one was summarized by FINRA with 10 lines and roughly 4 minutes... whoever wrote that one must have been late for lunch.. \\n\\nThe last thing I’d like to note here is the way in which short sellers use options to “cover” their positions. Wes gave a great overview of this in the AMA *(starting at 6:25)*. Basically, one group will buy puts and another group buys calls. This creates a synthetic share that is only provided if the option is activated. Regardless, short sellers will use that synthetic share to cover their short position and the regulators actually accept it… \\n\\nHowever, as Wes points out, most of those options expire without being activated which means the share is never delivered. This expiration can be set months down the road and allows the short seller to keep kicking the can.\\n\\nI doubt I need to say this, but we all remember the wild options activity that was happening shortly after GameStop spiked in January. u/HeyItsPixel was one of the first to point this out. While a lot of that activity was on the retail front, I suspect a lot of it was done by short sellers to cover those positions.\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n**5.** **Hedgies are f\\\\*cked…**\\n\\nI’m officially +20 pages deep and there’s still so much I’d like to say. It’s best saved for another time and another post, I suppose. So I guess I’ll wrap all of this up with some of the best news I can possibly provide…\\n\\nIt all started with a [73 page PDF](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) that was published in 2005 by a silverback named John D. Finnerty.\\n\\nJohn was a Professor of Finance at Fordham University when he published *“short selling, death spiral convertibles, and the profitability of stock manipulation”*. The document is loaded with sh\\\\*t that’s incredibly relevant today, especially when it comes to naked short selling. He dives into the exact formula that short sellers use, which is far beyond what my wrinkled brain can interpret, alone…\\n\\n..However, when firms are naked shorting a company with the goal of bankrupting them, they leave footprints which are only explained by this event. The proof is in the pudding, so to speak..\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ax7u0r4wfk171.jpg?width=1072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1828755bfe49c47ca178d960f91dfd21d8b0d680\\n\\nAny of this sound familiar?? \\n\\n*“The manipulator can not drive the share price close to zero unless he can naked short an extraordinary number of shares…* *this form of manipulation would result in… unusually heavy trading volume, and unusually large and persistent fails to deliver at the NSCC”.*\\n\\nAnyone else remember the volume in GME during the run-up in January? The total volume traded between **1/31/2021 and 2/5/2021 was 1,508,793,439** **shares**, or an average daily trade volume of **88,752,555 shares.** On 1/22/2021, the volume reached 197,157,946… that’s roughly 3x the number of shares that exist.. \\n\\nif this doesn’t sound like unusual volume then I’m not sure what is. Furthermore, the FTD report on GameStop was through the roof during this time:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brz98nbzfk171.jpg?width=1625&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83ae877853acd2ec65fa73f57216f00b708a7eab\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlla3ak0gk171.jpg?width=1038&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d4a1331f8c9d97b5338cc55a37310a95c9559b\\n\\n  \\n\\nNotice the statement where the manipulator will be relieved of its obligation to cover **IF** the firm’s shares are cancelled in bankruptcy? Did you happen to see footnotes 65 &amp; 66 in the first screenshot of his PDF? It references a company that he used for his analysis… \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdp3at43gk171.jpg?width=997&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8508c9d0c869544f0ccd3a15477abfd64d38897c\\n\\nCharter Communications had a whopping **241.8% short float in 2005**… **The ONLY way the manipulator could have escaped this was by bankrupting the company and relieving the obligation to repurchase those shares…**\\n\\nGuess what happened to Charter? They filed for [bankruptcy](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7189668&amp;page=1) in 2009…\\n\\nHowever, unlike John’s example where naked short sellers were driving down the price without opposition, GameStop had extremely high demand from retail investors to counter this activity. As I have discussed with Dr. T and Carl Hagberg, the run-up in volume during January and February was largely conducted by naked short sellers in an attempt to suppress the share price. As I have shown in the example with Goldman Sachs, firms will short sell during a buy-in for the same exact reason. To stabilize the price, you must stabilize supply and demand. \\n\\n…You know what Charter didn’t have? \\n\\nAN ARMY OF APES TO HODL THE STONK\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDIAMOND. F\\\\*CKING. HANDS'\n",

If you don\\'t already know, the DTCC stands for Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation and is broken into the following (primary) subsidiaries:\\n\\n1. **Depository Trust Company (DTC)** \\\\- *centralized clearing agency that makes sure grandma gets her stonks and the broker receives grandma\\'s tendies*\\n2. **National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)** \\\\- *provides clearing, settlement, risk management, and central counterparty (CCP) services to its members for broker-to-broker trades*\\n3. **Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC)** \\\\- *provides central counterparty (CCP) services to members that participate in the US government and mortgage-backed securities markets*\\n\\n*Brief* *history* *lesson: I promise it\\'s relevant (this* [*link*](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/museum/index.html) *provides all the info that follows).*\\n\\nThe DTC was created in 1973. It stemmed from the need for a centralized clearing company. Trading during the 60s went through the roof and resulted in many brokers having to quit before the day was finished so they could manually record their mountain of transactions. All of this was done on paper and each share certificate was physically delivered. This obviously resulted in many failures to deliver (FTD) due to the risk of human error in record keeping. In 1974, the Continuous Net Settlement system was launched to clear and settle trades using a rudimentary internet platform.\\n\\nIn 1982, the DTC started using a [Book-Entry Only](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookentrysecurities.asp) (BEO) system to underwrite bonds. For the first time, there were no physical certificates that actually traded hands. Everything was now performed virtually through computers. Although this was advantageous for many reasons, it made it MUCH easier to commit a certain type of securities fraud- naked shorting.\\n\\nOne year later they adopted [NYSE Rule 387](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/retired-rules/rule-387) which meant most securities transactions had to be completed using this new BEO computer system. Needless to say, explosive growth took place for the next 5 years. Pretty soon, other securities started utilizing the BEO system. It paved the way for growth in mutual funds and government securities, and even allowed for same-day settlement. At the time, the BEO system was a tremendous achievement. However, we were destined to hit a brick wall after that much growth in such a short time..

A major factor behind the crash was a disconnect between the price of stock and their corresponding derivatives. The value of any given stock should determine the derivative value of that stock. It shouldn\\'t be the other way around. **This is an important concept to remember as it will be referenced throughout the post.**\\n\\nIn the off chance that the market DID tank, they hoped they could contain their losses with [portfolio insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolioinsurance.asp#:~:text=Portfolio%20insurance%20is%20a%20hedging,also%20refer%20to%20brokerage%20insurance)*.* Another [article from the NY times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/business/a-computer-lesson-from-1987-still-unlearned-by-wall-street.html) explains this in better detail. \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf6ocoe9abu61.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e638c4479aceac77a003ae86fa1cfdd23f5406b8\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8igwi6mflbu61.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=853945852aea5a355266bf52b6f1fa573db1e29a\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fe78gr1qlbu61.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec59987333e04cef07541229161b3ff30881444\\n\\nA major disconnect occurred when these futures contracts were used to intentionally tank the value of the underlying stock. In a perfect world, organic growth would lead to an increase in value of the company (underlying stock). They could  do this by selling more products, creating new technologies, breaking into new markets, etc. This would trigger an organic change in the derivative\\'s value because investors would be (hopefully) more optimistic about the longevity of the company. It could go either way, but the point is still the same. This is the type of investing that most of us are familiar with: investing for a better future.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to spend too much time on the crash of 1987. I just want to identify the factors that contributed to the crash and the role of the DTC as they transitioned from a manual to an automatic ledger system. **The connection I really want to focus on is the ENORMOUS risk appetite these investors had. Think of how overconfident and greedy they must have been to put that much faith in a computer script.. either way, same problems still exist today.**\\n\\nFinally, the comment by Bruce Bartlett regarding the mismatched investment strategies between stocks and options is crucial in painting the picture of today\\'s market.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s do a super brief walkthrough of the main parties within the DTC before opening this **can of worms.**\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nI\\'m going to talk about three groups within the DTC- **issuers, participants, and Cede &amp; Co.**\\n\\nIssuers are companies that issue securities (stocks), while participants are the clearing houses, brokers, and other financial institutions that can utilize those securities. Cede &amp; Co. is a subsidiary of the DTC which holds the share certificates.\\n\\nParticipants have MUCH more control over the securities that are deposited from the issuer. Even though the issuer created those shares, participants are in control when those shares hit the DTC\\'s doorstep. The DTC transfers those shares to a holding account *(Cede &amp; Co.)* and the participant just has to ask \"*May I haff some pwetty pwease wiff sugar on top?\"*  \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n**Now, where\\'s that can of worms?**\\n\\nEverything was relatively calm after the crash of 1987.... until we hit 2003..\\n\\n*\\\\*deep breath\\\\**\\n\\nThe DTC started receiving several requests from issuers to pull their securities from the DTC\\'s depository. I don\\'t think the DTC was prepared for this because they didn\\'t have a written policy to address it, let alone an official rule. Here\\'s the half-assed response from the DTC:\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.sec.gov\\\\/rules\\\\/sro\\\\/34-47978.htm \\\\(section II\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1ctpj263zdu61.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ff2e2d543f53a6ece6d95c334ed995fe67f9c8d)\\n\\nRealizing this situation was heating up, the DTC proposed [SR-DTC-2003-02](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm#P19_6635)..\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/www.sec.gov\\\\/rules\\\\/sro\\\\/34-47978.htm#P19\\\\_6635](https://preview.redd.it/io22id3n7eu61.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424ef5b6a70d073c62a47f6a1b82cd739b527b88)\\n\\nHonestly, they were better of WITHOUT the new proposal.\\n\\nIt became an even BIGGER deal when word got about the proposed rule change. Naturally, it triggered a TSUNAMI of comment letters against the DTC\\'s proposal. There was obviously something going on to cause that level of concern.

I\\'d be pretty pissed, too! Have my shares deposited in a clearing company to take advantage of their computerized trades just to get kicked to the curb with NO WAY of getting my securities back...

IDK about y\\'all, but this \"trust us with your shares\" BS is starting to sound like a major con.\\n\\nThe DTC asked for feedback from all issuers and participants to gather a consensus before making a decision.

This evolved into trading systems that were also computerized, but not as sophisticated as they hoped.. They played a major part in the 1987 crash, along with severely desynchronized derivatives trading.\\n\\nIn 2003, the DTC denied issuers the right to withdraw their deposits because those securities were in the control of participants, instead. When issuer A deposits stock into the DTC and participant B shorts those shares into the market, that\\'s a form of [rehypothecation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees). This is what so many issuers were trying to express in their comment letters. In addition, it hurts their company by driving down it\\'s value.
